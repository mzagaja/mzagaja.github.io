title: A Transit Moonshot for Boston
comments: on

The most striking contrast between my life in Connecticut and Boston is how much more awful transit is in Boston. In Connecticut I get to most places by automobile. I hop in a car that for the most part parks for free in a lot near my destination. The car is comfortable. It plays the music I want. It is set to my custom temperature. Eight times out of ten I arrive quickly and with little delay. Boston could not be a larger contrast.

I walk from my apartment in Cambridge to Harvard Sq station. It takes ten minutes. As I enter the station I dodge the puffs of smoke and am harangued by beggars and solicitors. I rush to meet my train before it takes off. It is crowded. The hot blowers cause me to sweat profusely. I am squished between large numbers of people. I try and find a pole to hold on. The train stops at the next station and is delayed. Instead of twelve minutes my train part of the commute balloons to twenty, and this happens nearly twenty percent of the time. I finally exit Downtown Crossing. My twenty minute commute took thirty-five minutes and I went only five miles.
