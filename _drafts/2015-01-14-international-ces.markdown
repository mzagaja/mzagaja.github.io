If International CES is about anything, it is about the burn. The burning legs running across Las Vegas, the burning passion of entrepreneurs, and the burning of images into sensors by the press. The annual event spans the Las Vegas Convention Center, the Sands Expo, hospitality suites in adjoining hotels, and unaffiliated events hosted by participating companies. It accomplishes the feat of making the coverage of the event seem small in comparison to itself. After filiming numerous videos about individual products the burning question remains: what is life going to be like in the future?

Technology companies have launched a war on the destrction of their products. For 2015 durability is the new trend. Lenovo released tablets that you can write on with pencils and forks. ioSafe released hard disk enclosures that can survive fires and floods. LG showed us smartphones that heal themselves from scratches. The battery life of everything is longer. Gadget makers want you to feel comfortable taking their products to new places and to be rougher with them.

Innovators are also working to make technology more accessible. Companies like HP are now selling Windows PCs in the $200 to $100 range. Our sponsor, Axcelle, makes Android tablets that cost less than $100. With the introduction of Intel's Bay Trail and Morphield processors companies are providing more computing power and energy efficiency at lower price points. Soon it will be easy for families to afford screens for everyone or for schools to replace textbooks with inexpensive tablets. 

People want to tell their stories and increasingly they want to do it with photography and video. They want to tell these stories in high definition and to bring people into them. Sony and Kodak are creating cameras that provide a 360 degree views and high resolution action shots. Then companies like Oculus VR and ODG are creating interfaces that allow you to immerse yourself in virtual reality or experience augmented reality. Cerevo developed the LiveWedge, which brings pictue-in-picture, chromakey, and other professional features to a consumer price point. 

Combined these changes might not seem significant. It is not as exciting as going to Mars or developing cures for diseases, but these changes are going to impact the world. The accessibility of technology will create new markets for software and make automation more feasible. We will share our experiences in new ways that build understanding and create knowledge. As we adopt more technology we will worry about it less because it will work better and burn into the background as we live our lives.
