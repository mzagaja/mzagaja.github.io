The Rosie Project

I finally read a piece of fiction. A novel. It is not that I dislike fiction, but I do not enjoy bad writing and I really enjoy learning. If I pick-up a non-fiction book and it is poorly written or too dense I can at least rush through it and learn something. Fiction is a high stakes gamble. If the writing is bad then you are just left with wasted time. The Rosie Project is worth your time.

In this book genetics professor Don Tillman goes searching for a wife through online dating, a detailed questionnaire, and some other antics. Tillman has Aspergerâ€™s Syndrome and his logical approach to life leads to sad, funny, and heartwarming moments. I read the book because I was rooting for Don. I stayed glued to it because it was hilarious. I finished it because I needed to know what happened to him.

Usually I end reviews by telling you who the book is for, but this book is for everyone. Pick-up a copy and bring it with you to the beach this summer. You will not regret it.
