The Connecticut General Assembly may pass laws, but in Connecticut the inmates are running the asylum. Nowhere is this more evident than in the implementation and adherence to our Freedom of Information laws. As Matthew Kauffman at the Hartford Courant noted in June of 2013 the Newtown town clerk (http://courantblogs.com/investigative-reporting/in-the-newtown-clerks-office-a-dishonorable-end-to-six-months-of-lawlessness/)[illegally withheld access to death certificates related to the shootings at Sandy Hook]. The Newtown town clerk's office was so brazen in its defiance of the law of our state that in testimony to the legislature it acknowledged that "according to current law, these death certificates are public information."

It took the courts six months to regain control of the situation. In spite of (http://www.state.ct.us/foi/Advisory_Opinions_&_Dec/AO_79.htm)[strong precedent] in favor of the release of records the clerks defied state law and lobbied to change it so they would not have to release the death certificates. For six months we had anarchy in Newtown.

This is one of the most egregious examples of a system of towns and cities openly ignoring the state's freedom of information statutes but it is not the only one. The freedom of information statute states that public agencies shall provide copies in an electronic format if the agency can reasonbly make the copy. Section 1-212 states that the fee of a copy provided electronically shall not exceed the cost to the public agency. Yet cities like New Haven openly charge inflated rates for electronic copies of items like its voter file. 

Much to its credit the Freedom of Information commission is extremely responsive to public inquiries but it is also backlogged. This backlog creates delays in obtaining public information which may lead to delays in important public policy research or a lack of confidence in government itself. This situation could be 

The text of the FOI statute is freely available on the state website. It's provisions are widely discussed and publicly debated in the news media. 

Currently the FOI statute provides for (http://www.ct.gov/foi/cwp/view.asp?a=4163&Q=489176)[penalties] for the willful destruction of the public records and for failing to comply with an order of the Freedom of Information Commission. Unfortunately it is clear that these two penalties are not enough to discourage people from ignoring our laws. The state legislature should reassert its authority over freedom of information requests by providing for a third class of penalty that will strip public employees who defy the statute of their jobs and put them in jail. Public employees are entrusted with carrying out public functions, and when they fail to comply with the law, especially law related to freedom of information, it undermines the trust and credibility of our government.
