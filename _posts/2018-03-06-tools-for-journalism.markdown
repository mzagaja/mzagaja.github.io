One of the places I think is ripe for innovation is journalism. That is why I have been working on some side projects with Doug and Christine of [CTNewsJunkie](http://www.ctnewsjunkie.com/). Last week we launched [bills.ctnewsjunkie.com](https://bills.ctnewsjunkie.com/), a tool for sharing your opinion about activity in the Connecticut legislature. We are using software as lever to help inform the public about their world.

Over a year ago I worked with them to launch the [CTNewsJunkie Voter Guide](https://vote.ctnewsjunkie.com). The idea behind the voter guide was to better make available to the public information about the candidates running for office. The app has seen large year over year growth, especially as we focused on providing information on municipal candidates last cycle. People are clearly starving for information about their communities and they want something that is a little more authoritative than Facebook.

Check out my two apps and share any feedback you have in the comments below.
