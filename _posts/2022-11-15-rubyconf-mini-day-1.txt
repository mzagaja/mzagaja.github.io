I am at RubyConf Mini and it has been a good learning experience. John Hawthorne gave a master class on optimizing something in the Ruby programming language in [his presentation on making `is_a?` fast](https://www.rubyconfmini.com/program#Making-.is_a?-Fast). [Stephanie Minn taught us how to pair program with non-violent communication](https://www.rubyconfmini.com/program#Empathetic-Pair-Programming-with-Nonviolent-Communication). Finally [Brown Professor Barbara Tannenbaum](https://www.brown.edu/academics/theatre-arts-performance-studies/barbara-tannenbaum) gave us a crash course in effective communication.

### Swag Bag Round-up
* Socks from every sponsor made in the USA by [Sock Club](https://custom.sockclub.com).
* [How DNS Works by Julia Evans](https://wizardzines.com/zines/dns/) makes it easier to understand...how DNS works!
* Stickers!
* It's a convenient way to package everything together, but I did not need yet another re-usable tote bag. I would love to see places start using [printed paper bags](https://www.vistaprint.com/packaging/shopping-bags/paper-bags) as a less wasteful alternative. 

### The Gift of In-Person Conference is Focus
Having a few days to ignore the day job and focus on the content is more effective than trying to process it from home on video. The reality is I am likely to ignore or skip lots of video content. Whereas in-person content is digested more easily. So for that, I am grateful to be attending in-person this year.
