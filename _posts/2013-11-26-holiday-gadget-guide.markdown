As a gadget geek people tend to ask me what they should get or consider getting others for Christmas. People have different price ranges and preferences but I think that it is worth highlighting some of the underrated products:

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EN27TCI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00EN27TCI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=zagajacom-20">Wacom Intuos Pen Small Tablet (CTL480)</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=zagajacom-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00EN27TCI" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
 - I have used the older Bamboo model for a year or two now. It costs under $100 and works well with <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pixelmator/id407963104?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l74i" target="itunes_store">Pixelmator</a> or your preferred photo and image editing applications.

Besides giving you access to data about and being able to reset the check engine lights, it also helps you improve your fuel economy. Beeps scold you for going above 70MPH or braking too hard. I found my driving performance became smoother after installing this gizmo.

It involves little hassle and works great after setup. For $35 it can even be a cool stocking stuffer.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007PRHNHO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B007PRHNHO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=zagajacom-20">Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard Cover Black for iPad 2 and iPad (3rd/4th generation) (920-004013)</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=zagajacom-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B007PRHNHO" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> - If you know someone with an iPad, a keyboard cover like this one makes it much more useful. The new model is $100 but they all connect via bluetooth so you can still use the cheaper cover with the new iPad Air, it will just not connect to the new iPad like a cover the way it will with the older models. There is also an iPad mini version as well. When I go on vacation I now only bring my iPad with the keyboard cover.
