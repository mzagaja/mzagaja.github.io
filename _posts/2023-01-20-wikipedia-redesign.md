title: Wikipedia Gets a Glow Up

Wikimedia Foundation announced the release of a [Wikipedia redesign](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wikipedia-desktop/) this week. I was surprised because I do not think I have seen the Wikipedia design change in many years. Take a look and [make a contribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Introduction) after you read something interesting.

### Why It Matters
Wikipedia is a treasure of the Internet and it was starting to feel a bit dated. This redesign makes Wikipedia a bit easier to use and navigate.

### What I Like
* The navigation bar on the left for the table of contents.
* Better spacing for menu items and labels.
* Using color and an underline to delineate the currently selected menu item.

### What is Missing
* [Wikitext markup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikitext) is still confusing compared to Markdown.
* Inline section header links.

### Go Deeper
[Refactoring UI](https://www.refactoringui.com) is a book from the authors of Tailwind CSS on improving user interfaces.
