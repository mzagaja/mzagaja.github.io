Disney [filed a complaint in federal court against Gov. Ron DeSantis](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23789600-file-stamped-disney-complaint1) yesterday. At 74 pages you might be tempted to run it through the [Kagi Summarizer](https://kagi.com/summarizer/index.html). I do not recommend doing so. Even skimming it gives you a few gems.

### Why It Matters
Some of the fun of lawyering is the flourish you can add to your writing. Many legal complaints are dry, verbose, and put you to sleep. Disneyâ€™s lawyers knew this would be read not just by the judge and opposing party, but by the general public and wrote this document for everyone.

### Some Favorite Quotes
> The State of Florida has flourished in the years since Walt Disney himself surveyed many acres of swampland in 1963 and dreamed the possibility of Walt Disney World.

> Walt Disney Parks and Resorts U.S., Inc. is a Florida corporation with its principal place of business in Orange County, Florida. Disney owns and operates Walt Disney World in Central Florida. Guests from around the world visit to enjoy a Disney vacation, where family members of all ages laugh, play, and learn together.

> In 1963, Walt Disney looked down on acres of undeveloped Central Florida land from an airplane seat and saw potential.
