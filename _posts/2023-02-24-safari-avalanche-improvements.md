title: Safari's Avalanche of Improvements
layout: post

Safari’s recent large number of improvements [has been noticed by folks in the web development community](https://infrequently.org/2023/02/safari-16-4-is-an-admission/#webkit's-roaring-twenties). Many of the improvements are fixes for longstanding bugs. Safari is also adopting a large number of features championed by folks who want to create web applications that work similarly to native apps, called progressive web applications.

### Why It Matters
Apple’s increased investment and growth is a good sign for the future of the web. We continue to have a robust alternative built to natively work well with MacOS. Many folks who previously needed to make native applications can now choose to make a web app.

### Zoom Out
A majority of websites do not take advantage of the new features. It is exciting that Safari can do so much more, but many of us just need to read a restaurant menu. These features are exciting for software engineers like me and well resourced companies, but most sites will not need them.

### What They’re Saying
I asked my colleagues how they felt about these changes and a couple themes emerged:
* Excitement that a bunch of things that are currently native apps with lots of web views can maybe be just a web application now.
* Relief that longstanding CSS bugs that have been driving them bonkers are fixed. Safari users should see less weirdness on websites.
