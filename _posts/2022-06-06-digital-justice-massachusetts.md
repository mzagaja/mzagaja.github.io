From the [Boston Globe](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/06/05/opinion/hear-ye-hear-ye-accessing-justice-digital-age/):
> â€¦making technology work all day, every day, for the thousands of litigants, lawyers, judges, and for the public seeking access to proceedings and to documents in 95 courthouses is quite another. That will require replacing an antiquated patchwork of a system with one that offers the same range of public access whether the court is in Boston or the Berkshires.
> 
> To do that, judicial officials will need legislative approval of a $164 million bond bill, originally proposed but ignored during the 2019-20 session. The bill has been languishing in the House Ways and Means Committee since April 7, with the clock ticking down on a session due to end formal proceedings on July 31.

Great to see the Editorial Board speaking out in favor of this important [bond bill](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/H4499).
