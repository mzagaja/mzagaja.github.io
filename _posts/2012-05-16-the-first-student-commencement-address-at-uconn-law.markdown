Back when I was thinking about running for graduation speaker I asked the library archivist to pull some of previous speeches from the law school archives. I thought that this one, which was the first student address, was good. The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UConnLawSchool">UConn Law Facebook Page</a> adds the following tidbit:
<blockquote>Did you know a student address was not always part of the Commencement ceremony? Dean Blumberg first proposed the idea of having a student speak in January of 1982 and the question was put to campus-wide vote. 45 people said they wanted a student speaker, 42 said no. With the vote that close the committee decided against having a student speaker for the class of 1982. A year later feelings changed and Willa Perlmutter gave the address posted below.</blockquote>
