From the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/jony-ive-apple-design-interview-profile-lovefrom-11666733971):
> Sir Jony Ive—as of 2012, the Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire—has his name on 1,628 U.S. patents, part of 14,000 he holds worldwide encompassing both software and hardware.

Lots of interesting nuggets in this interview. One of the most interesting parts to me is that he can write an awful lot that he can’t draw. Apparently a picture is not worth 1000 words.
