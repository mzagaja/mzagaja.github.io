In 2015 I traveled with Lon Seidman to explore CES and record dispatches from the floor. He’s been visiting nearly every year since, and his dispatches remain one of the closest things to being there. He likes to find smaller companies and items missed by mainstream outfits like The Verge and CNET, so it’s worth a watch if you want to see things that are cool but not part of the marketing hype machines that fuel the larger outfits. He has a [playlist of his dispatches on YouTube](http://lon.tv/CES2023).
