<p>If you are looking for a good read I highly recommend Daniel Gilbert&#039;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stumbling-Happiness-Daniel-Gilbert/dp/1400042666">Stumbling on Happiness</a>. It is an interesting and fun read, with lots of insights on the human mind that I did not know about. It explains why and how we are happy, and the value of that happiness. It manages to be entertaining yet serious at the same time. You can also watch his talk at <a href="http://www.ted.com">TED</a>, which covers the basic idea of the book below.</p>
