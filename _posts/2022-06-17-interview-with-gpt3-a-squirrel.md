title: Interview with GPT-3, Who is Secretly a Squirrel
---
From [AI Weirdness](https://www.aiweirdness.com/interview-with-a-squirrel/):
> Reporter: What do you say to people who doubt that you are a squirrel?
> GPT-3: I say that they should come and see for themselves. I am a squirrel, and I am very happy being one.

An amusing rebuttal to folks who [think Googleâ€™s Lamda AI is sentient](https://wapo.st/3N1L00a). They show how easy it is to lead a conversational AI to respond in a way we might expect, which might also convince naive users it is sentient.
