One of Facebook's most underutilized features is its lists. If you are a heavy Facebook user like me they allow you to create feeds that focus in on specific areas or interests. Then you can share them with others. Since I could not find a Connecticut focused one when I learned about this feature I built one using about 80 news sources that I am aware of. You can see it and subscribe by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lists/664745338142">clicking here</a>. If you have suggestions for pages to add please contact me or comment below. I have left out members of the Connecticut General Assembly as they have <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lists/10151169544521725">their own list</a>.
