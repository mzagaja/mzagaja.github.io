Today I forgot my <a href="http://www.bose.com/controller?url=/shop_online/headphones/audio_headphones/index.jsp">Bose earbuds</a> and had to bring the stock Apple ear buds that came with my iPhone to the gym. I had never used these and was surprised how terrible the quality is. Much of the detail of the song disappeared when I was using the Apple ear buds. It's no wonder that Apple was able to sell lower quality 128kbps AAC files for so long. Once you get used to speakers or ear buds with quality it is difficult to go back. If you want to get good quality audio for cheap then I recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-HD201-Lightweight-Over-Ear-Headphones/dp/B0007XJSQC/">Sennheiser HD 201</a> headphones. I also think that it is worth scouring eBay for deals. I got some Harmon Kardon Soundsticks for about $60 there. With less than a $100 investment you can finally start enjoying your music the way it was meant to be heard.

If you own an automobile you should check out <a href="http://www.adamspolishes.com">Adam's Polishes</a>. I discovered them when I was looking for a way to buff out scratches on the used car I purchased a little over a year ago. In addition to selling polishing kits they also have car wash kits and all sorts of cleaners to tackle any part of your car that might be dirty or old. They also have all great <a href="http://www.adamspolishes.com/t-videos.aspx">instructional videos</a> on how to properly use the products. By investing a little bit of money you can improve the appearance of your car and remove marks or dirt that otherwise has been stuck on there for years.

What underrated products would you recommend?
