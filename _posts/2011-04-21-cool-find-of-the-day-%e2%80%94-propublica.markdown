Today's cool find is courtesy of my enjoyment of <a href="http://www.npr.org">NPR</a> and <a href="http://www.npr.org/money">Planet Money</a>. They had a partnership with an organization known as ProPublica. I decided to explore their website today and they have a <a href="http://www.propublica.org/tools/">fantastic section on data extraction and analysis</a>. If you want to get started with data analysis they have some great techniques, especially for PDF extraction.
