title: Google Year in Search 2018
---
I always enjoy Googleâ€™s video they post looking back at the year:

I have spent 2018 trying to blog more and this video inspired me to look back at my blog posts over the past year. The top blog posts were as follows:

* [Fixing the Tweetbot Permission Denied Error](http://www.zagaja.com/2012/09/fixing-the-tweetbot-permission-denied-error/) - this was mostly from search traffic and died down in October.
* [Civic Tech Stacks](http://www.zagaja.com/2018/12/civic-tech-stacks/)
* [Herman Miller Aeron 2 Review](http://www.zagaja.com/2017/06/herman-miller-aeron-2-review/)
* [The Rescue](http://www.zagaja.com/2018/03/the-rescue/)
* [Building a Process](http://www.zagaja.com/2018/03/building-a-process/)

The other popular page was my home page, which I assume is the place where many people are reading these individual posts.
