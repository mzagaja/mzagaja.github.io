On Friday I received a pair of [AirPods Pro (2nd Generation)](https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/) to replace the AirPods I have had for several years with a decaying battery. Using them for a few days I can confirm that they are the best headphones I have ever used. The noise cancelling is uncanny, as good if not better than my Beats Studio 3 wireless. If you have a Mac and iPhone you should buy these.

Using AirPods Pro is much more convenient than any other earbuds I have owned. The stem squeezing or swiping actions to control the audio is much more reliable and less likely to knock the device out of your ears than my original AirPods. They paired to my Mac without issue and unlike the regular AirPods switching between devices feels much more seamless. The wireless charging capability is the frosting on the cake. It is easier to drop them on my [Anker charge pad](https://amzn.to/3BKGmQC) or Apple Watch charger than to have to plug them in.

Finally the sound quality is the best I have ever heard in earbuds. Instruments that blended together with AirPods are distinct and powerful in the AirPods Pro. Details that I would miss in shows or movies using my soundbar bring another dimension to the experience. Pairing these with spatial audio on Apple TV is impressive. Give it a try.
