title: An Oral History of Goldeneye on N64
---
A [fun article from Mel Magazine](https://melmagazine.com/an-oral-history-of-goldeneye-007-on-the-n64-129844f1c5ab):
>GoldenEye 007 was originally planned to be a 2D, single-player side-scrolling game, much like Donkey Kong, another game that British developers Rare were producing at the time for the SNES. However, lead developer Martin Hollis suggested it be a 3D first-person shooter for the Nintendo 64, a system and technology that didn’t even fully exist yet. He got his way, and assembled a ragtag team of new-to-gaming developers to begin working on what was expected to be “just another film license” game — games that typically rode the movie’s fame, but didn’t prove to be smash hits, critically or commercially.

I remember playing Goldeneye on my brother’s Nintendo 64 when I was younger. We did not own it but it was a favorite rental.
