It's Friday night and I took the time to finish the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Louis-D-Brandeis-Melvin-Urofsky/dp/0375423664">biography of Louis Brandeis</a> that I've been reading. It was a dense tome. I started reading it months ago and in some places it was painfully boring and detailed. I did enjoy the descriptions of his early years. If there is one take-away I had from the book it is the importance of preparation and knowing your subject matter better than anyone else in the room. That is how Brandeis was able to succeed. I also cannot help but to be surprised but also approve of his desire to serve as counsel to the situation as opposed to individuals in many matters. By encouraging collaboration Brandeis was able to craft better solutions for all parties involved. Otherwise the book explored nearly every facet of Brandeis's life in meticulous detail. It is worth the read if you are interested in Brandeis but otherwise too dense and boring at parts to be enjoyable.
