I am currently in the process of restructuring this website to make it look nicer, since I love playing with HTML and CSS, but also to make this a better portfolio pitstop. I have come to realize that a lot of blogging these days is seen and done on Facebook and so I have been posting my blog type posts there. I will probably still post here but am going to modify the site to better reflect the fact that when people land they're likely just wondering who I am.
