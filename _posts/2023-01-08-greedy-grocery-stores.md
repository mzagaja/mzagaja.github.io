title: When Your Grocery Store is Too Greedy
layout: post
---
I never did a ton of comparison shopping on food items because I always presumed that in an efficient market food prices would generally land within a couple dollars of each other. You could save some money, but even over a year you were not going to move the needle a ton. Rising prices at Wegmans made me rethink this and I now am eating my shoe.

### By The Numbers
* In March 2022 a rotisserie chicken from Wegmans on Instacart was $6.89.
* Today the same rotisserie chicken is a greedy $11.49. a 66% increase.
* Costco famously charges $5 for its rotisserie chicken.
* The differential in shifting our typical bacon consumption from Wegmans to Costco would be nearly $200.

### Meal Delivery Apps are Even Worse
Recently I was offered a 50% off incentive for an Uber Eats delivery meal, and so I got $30 of food for $15. The entire discount was eaten away by a service fee ($4.97), a delivery fee ($3.49), and the tip for the delivery person ($4.21). I had a great few years of decent pricing, but now the service and delivery fees are creeping up, my enthusiasm is falling.

### Now I am a Costco Believer
Not everything is cheaper at Costco or makes sense to buy in bulk. I hate shopping in-person which is why I have been such a fan of Instacart. However the savings end up being worth it, and Costco offers a partnership with Instacart including a $20/off a year discount on [Instacart+](https://www.instacart.com/store/account/instacart-plus), and competitive pricing on its [white label Instacart site](https://sameday.costco.com).

### One More Thing
Costco also has exclusive discounts on gift cards and subscriptions, including [$30 off an annual subscription to Apple News+](https://www.costco.com/CategoryDisplay?storeId=10301&identifier=apple-subscriptions&langId=-1&catalogId=10701&krypto=KnNp7GEfcgwoZ4zeFOrJ3EALWPrhCagKcrRuWkV7ut%2FOmjeuHlOssX%2BMOmNNYbVlHXQwi5c7szT2QaxXIPC%2BnHlfzLsWnJBZcBtIRz%2B1IvQOK09QHcUAK%2BO790hKEU3t6%2BV4RzGBaYF%2BAuXsCegqiw%3D%3D&ddkey=http%3ALogoff).
