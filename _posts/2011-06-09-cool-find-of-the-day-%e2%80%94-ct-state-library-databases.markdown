I've been spending a lot of time at the <a href="http://www.cslib.org/">Connecticut State Library</a> recently. If you are a resident you can get a state library card for free and this entitles you to access their <a href="http://www.cslib.org/eresourceshome.htm">databases</a> at no charge.  Two databases that are especially neat are the Oxford English Dictionary online and Safari Bookshelf. OED Online normally costs $295 a year and is the most comprehensive source of information on the English language. Safari Bookshelf has a subset of about 78 titles from <a href="http://oreilly.com/">O'Reilly Media</a>. If you were looking for some books on programming, blogging, or twittering its the place to go!
