title: Ditching Google Analytics for Piwik Pro
layout: post
---
I was excited to learn yesterday that [Piwik Pro](https://piwik.pro) has a free tier now. I used Piwik a long time ago when I migrated Lumen Database from Google Analytics. At the time it was called Matamo and I actually liked it better than Google Analytics.

### Why It Matters
As folks continue to be concerned about the monopoly that Google has, making sure we try and use alternatives keeps them on their toes. From a personal standpoint the user interface of Google Analytics is not great, and I am excited to see what Piwik Pro does.

### Some Nice Features
* Compliance with GDPR and other privacy regulations. This was the main reason we switched at Lumen.
* 500,000 actions per month is perfect for small sites like mine.
* It looks like they already have more spam filtering than Googleâ€™s solution.

### The Downside
14 month data retention on the free plan means no more comparing my traffic to previous years.
