* [MBTA to cut weekday service on three lines](https://www.wbur.org/news/2022/06/17/mbta-to-cut-weekday-train-trips-blue-orange-red-lines) is a catastrophe for Boston. They are all heavily trafficked and will cause folks to lose faith in the MBTA. I [shared thoughts on twitter](https://twitter.com/mzagaja/status/1538151394846420997?s=21&t=rOE54Ioxa4pe1IPndDqPCQ).

* Vox has an [long but insightful analysis of why return to the office is not working](https://www.vox.com/recode/23161501/return-to-office-remote-not-working). I continue to think hybrid is a myth. Jobs are primarily in-person or remote. In many cases hybrid is remote with a commute.
