title: What Kind of Year It Has Been

Scripture tells us to run with endurance the race that is set before us. As a runner I know that means preparing for the expected, but being ready for the unexpected. 2022 did not end up being what I expected.

2022 opened with the Omicron surge. Instead of defeating COVID we are stuck in a stalemate. Many folks have recognized we cannot pause living life for a virus that is not going away, but unfortunately have given up trying to battle it at all. I got it twice this past year, and both times were less fun than the easy to get booster shot I took a month ago.

My heart was stolen from me at a beauty pageant. In August I went with my wife to an event in Florida where one of the contestants held a heart health awareness event in partnership with [Who We Play For](https://www.whoweplayfor.org/). An EKG reading looked a bit strange. As the doctors ran more tests, I was told I cannot run…for now. My dream of a new half marathon record is on hold.

But just because one dream is on hold does not mean life is on hold. I relaxed with my wife in Martha’s Vineyard and [role played Star Wars in Disney World](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/star-wars-galactic-starcruiser/overview/). I staffed my first [TED conference](https://ted2022.ted.com) in Vancouver. I started the Urban League Heat Pump Accelerator Project at [Code for Boston](https://www.codeforboston.org). My brother came up to [watch The Killers with me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ha4G3RuOn_I). From New York City to Washington D.C. I visited friends up and down the east coast. When you are told life could have been stolen from you, it feels natural to try and steal some life back.

I do not know what 2023 will bring, but as long as I keep on living, I plan to live it to its fullest. Happy new year!
