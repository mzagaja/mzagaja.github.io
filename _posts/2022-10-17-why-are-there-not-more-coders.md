In trying to answer the question “why are there not more coders?” I started to look for data. As someone who enjoys coding I always presumed most folks that tried to learn would also like it and there was simply a challenge of spreading the word. However the data tells a bleaker story.

### By the Numbers
* [Out of 500 people who joined Reddit’s /r/learnprogramming community 12 became software engineers and found a job](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/xlprsg/i_asked_500_people_on_this_sub_if_they_were_able/).
	* Most popular reason to stop: “I realized I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would" - 191 out of 226 people (84%)
* [Only 1% of the people who intend to get a certificate from Harvard’s CS50x course, their most popular MOOC, obtain it](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2889436).
* BLS notes there is a growth of a 162,000 software jobs a year, and [many of the openings are from people exiting the field](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm#tab-6).
