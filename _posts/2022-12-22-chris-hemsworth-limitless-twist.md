I have been watching [Limitless with Chris Hemsworth](https://www.disneyplus.com/series/limitless-with-chris-hemsworth/2wow8Otyubmk). It involves great outdoors videography that the National Geographic crew is famous for, combined with sometimes questionable scientific claims and Chris Hemsworth doing ridiculous stunts. The mini-series is woven together with the idea that Hemsworth is looking for ways to live a longer life.

### Finale (Semi) Spoilers Below
The last episode went in a different direction from everything that preceded it. If you are a fan of [Nathan Fielderâ€™s The Rehearsal](https://www.hbo.com/the-rehearsal) you can skip straight to the finale and feel at home. Hemsworth is moved into a senior living facility with a mix of real seniors and actors to experience life as himself in fifty years. The machismo of the previous episodes melts away to reveal a story that is emotional and human. Bring a box of tissues.
