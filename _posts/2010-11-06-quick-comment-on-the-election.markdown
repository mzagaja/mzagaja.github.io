Sites such as the CT Mirror have been <a href="http://www.ctmirror.org/story/8352/foley-refuses-concede-says-it-may-well-take-recount">posting articles</a> about the Connecticut gubernatorial election. Based on posts I've seen on twitter and facebook along these media stories it appears that people are overblowing the problems. Even with the problem ballots tossed Malloy has a win that is greater than needed for a recount. Certainly there was some negligence in Bridgeport but ultimately that negligence will not have had an impact on the final outcome. Furthermore are some people trying to blame Susan Bysiewicz, who has little control over the matter. It was probably a mistake for her to hold the press conference and put herself in front the spotlight considering she lacked control over this, but I don't think she can be blamed for the problems that occurred over the past few days..
