I have installed the WP-O-Matic plug-in and so now my posts on the <a href="http://www.myleftnutmeg.com">MyLeftNutmeg blog</a> will be automatically imported into the homepage. Â Their titles will link directly to the posts on the MyLeftNutmeg site but you will still be able to see them here. Hopefully it will keep this site fresher and allow the political posts to get a little more circulation online.
