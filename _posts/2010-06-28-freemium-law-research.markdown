Via the <a href="http://www.geeklawblog.com/2010/06/fastcases-public-library-of-law.html">3 Geeks and a Law Blog</a> I discovered that <a href="http://www.fastcase.com">Fastcase</a> has a free legal resource called <a href="http://www.plol.org">Public Library of Law</a> that lets you search recent court cases and statutes. A welcome addition to using <a href="http://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a> to search federal cases for free. These still won't completely replace WestLaw and Lexis anytime soon but they're certainly getting there. I tried a free trial of the paid version of Fastcase a while back and was actually rather impressed. The interface was less clunky than WestLaw and Lexis and it was in fact faster. The downside is the lack of those time saving headnotes. Either way these resources are worth checking out and adding to your bookmarks.
