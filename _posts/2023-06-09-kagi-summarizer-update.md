Kagi has an update to its [summarizer functionality](https://kagi.com/summarizer/index.html) that lets you ingest a giant piece of content, output a summary, and then ask its large language model questions specific to this content.

### Why It Matters
Instead of having to read a large piece of writing or listen to a super long podcast, you can get the key points. You can then asks questions specific to your interests. If you’re consuming writing for its utility instead of entertainment, this is a big time saver.

### What to Try
* Long podcasts
* YouTube Videos
* Big PDFs.

### The Lesson for Writers and Content Creators
A lot of content can be filler. If you’re a writer it is worth learning to use headings, smaller paragraphs, and other tools to more concisely convey your ideas. Also check out [Smart Brevity](https://www.amazon.com/Smart-Brevity-Power-Saying-More/dp/1523516976).
