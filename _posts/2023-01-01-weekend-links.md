Happy New Year! I have weekend links for you all to enjoy:
- [Southie Gut](https://www.instagram.com/southiegut/) on Instagram chronicles one family’s gut renovation of a row house in my neighborhood. The list of things that have gone wrong was surprising.
- [The Shameful Open Secret Behind Southwest’s Failure](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/31/opinion/southwest-airlines-computers.html?unlocked_article_code=2bBOfMo8RK8P72KT9XoE7R9lOHKcEtxwigCEX9bSEp_AMH46HDrbSakJOgfp7JFSttrV7eTqHctMCubCQdlYyz9zyqjVZtkt1gOVAL6aXLTNqSUIkvT0-SozSsans8_rFAgz7jaVaTZ2ZR1ZRqrZBMawDe57SYkhfWGAwgP7uPibJDYS0S5OY-ktUHeBd3YyguqYiQ2QPuo8UgsH6ayW6diqlzh6KakA-tMR87twakE2LdypLRiLuQrwfG_eH6_c2dO4W2AIecglizrE4qb9aoh3rdiiL3I7nJoQqt85d7D2ZzCH3zXX3JFkd2ZcFDz8BKjbHzn1JEeE_FJvEzwTYdT_PXs08g&smid=share-url) is a good explanation of technical debt and the role it played in this past week’s airline meltdown.
- [Glass Onion](https://www.netflix.com/title/81458416) was a fun watch on Netflix. Directed by Rian Johnson of The Last Jedi. Keep an eye out for the TED cameos.
- [How to Tame Your Wandering Mind](https://www.ted.com/talks/amishi_jha_how_to_tame_your_wandering_mind) was one of my most influential TED talks of 2022. I increased my use of Headspace to 15 minutes in the morning and now it’s easier to focus on debugging my code.
- [How to Write Less but Say More](https://www.ted.com/talks/jim_vandehei_how_to_write_less_but_say_more) along with its accompanying book helped me re-think how to write this blog. The data shows you all enjoy the punchier style with more bullets and headers than my rambling. Though I promise there is a longer form piece coming soon.
