I recently started reading [Hack Your Bureaucracy](https://amzn.to/3DjStXa) by [Nick Sinai](https://twitter.com/nicksinai?s=21&t=_NOEbHkg8dMMgrMC6wsQ2g) and [Marina Nitze](https://twitter.com/marinanitze?s=21&t=_NOEbHkg8dMMgrMC6wsQ2g). As a part of this I have decided to open a #book-club channel on the [Code for Boston Slack](https://communityinviter.com/apps/cfb-public/default-badge). We have a few other folks reading the book and sharing their thoughts as they go through each of the chapters. I am hoping we can also setup a Slack huddle or Zoom call to discuss things after folks have finished reading. If you’re interested in Civic Tech and reading the book, you’re welcome to join us!
