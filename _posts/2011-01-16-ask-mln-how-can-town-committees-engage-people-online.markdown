title: Ask MLN - How can town committees engage people online?
tags: []

I know people typically post articles and their own analysis but today I have a question to pose to the community. I am working with my town committee to reach out to people in town that may be wandering the internets. We <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=108767165841093">setup a facebook page</a> and we have <a href="http://wethersfield.dems.info/">a website</a>. However these things should not exist in a vacuum. We're doing this with the goal of getting people involved. We want more members that will participate and we want people that might consider serving as a commissioner or candidate.

What do you think we should be doing to reach out? Where are Connecticut townspeople hanging out online?
