The FAA is [seeking comments on shrinking airline seats](https://www.faa.gov/seat-size-comments). If you travel and find airline seats uncomfortable, you should weigh in.

### Why It Matters
Airlines want to cram more people into their planes. But if you travel, it becomes less comfortable to do so in standard class seats. Pricing may remain competitive but the quality of the product is getting worse. 

### By the Numbers
* The Boeing 737-800 flown by United Airlines has a [seat width as little as 16.3”](https://www.united.com/ual/en/us/fly/travel/inflight/aircraft/737-800.html)
* [The Airbus A320 has a “roomy” seat width of 18”](https://www.delta.com/us/en/aircraft/airbus/a320)
