After talking to him on the phone I returned to Gengras Volvo to talk with the service manager, John Jeffries. After showing him the problem that I identified with the car he agreed that it should have been caught and that the work they recommended was not necessarily appropriate to my problem. While John may or may not have been obligated to do right by me, he offered to fix some of the other things that they noticed were wrong with my car. At the end of the day I will never know how the tech missed the problem of the hose but to me, symbolically, it makes a huge difference when a business tries to do right when they screw up. Kudos to them for making the effort.
