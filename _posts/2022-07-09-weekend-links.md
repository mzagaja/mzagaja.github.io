* David Sparks [Shortcuts Field Guide for Mac](https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2022/05/announcing-the-shortcuts-for-mac-field-guide/) is a great resource if you want to learn how to automate things on your Mac.
* I recently enjoyed [More than Robots](https://www.disneyplus.com/movies/more-than-robots/1OkBDAcESiGf) on Disney+ about the [FIRST Robotics program](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc).
* [Youâ€™re Not Allowed to Have the Best Sunscreens in the World](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/07/us-sunscreen-ingredients-outdated-technology-better-eu-asia/661433/) is a look into why European sunscreens have effective ingredients that feel less icky on the body, but the FDA has yet to approve.
