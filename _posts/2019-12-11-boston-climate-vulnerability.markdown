title: Greater Boston Climate Vulnerability Assessment Website Launch
---
Today my team at [MAPC](https://www.mapc.org/) launched an interactive website to share our organization's [research on climate vulnerability in Greater Boston](https://climate-vulnerability.mapc.org/). This website was a true sprint: we only had a week to build it. However, we learned some cool things along the way.

The first thing we learned is [how to pre-project maps in D3.js](https://github.com/MAPC/infrastructure/blob/master/docs/D3%20Map%20Setup.md). This is an important skill if you want to display a large amount of [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org) on a page because many userâ€™s browsers will crash or slow down if they need to process too much GeoJSON. If your D3 map is not working, pre-projection might be the answer to your problems.

The second we learned was the value of building a repeatable data transformation pipeline. During the development process, we went through tens of versions of the source data which arrived as a shapefile from our researcher. If we had to re-create the GeoJSON transformation process it could have taken hours at a critical moment to update the data. Instead, we spent some time upfront creating a pipeline of a couple of shell commands that reliably transformed the source shapefile into GeoJSON. A good data transformation pipeline makes iteration a wonderful luxury.

Finally, [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) allows for rapid iteration, prototyping, and deployment. For a site that displays content that rarely changes or updates, GitHub Pages and Jekyll is a great choice. Using Jekyll allows us to organize our CSS with [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) and to quickly preview our local changes with the `jekyll serve --livereload` command. If you want to quickly build a static website, these tools minimize the distance between code and production.
