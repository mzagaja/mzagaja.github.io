From [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/people-working-from-home-in-a-snowstorm-may-be-producing-more-than-you-are/):
>Bossesâ€™ reluctance to let employees work from home persists despite the widely reported findings of a study by Stanford and Beijing universities that showed home workers were more productive.

Many larger employers in Connecticut have moved to a work from home model. Aetna and Pitney Bowes both have programs where workers can work from home and they rent desks or conference rooms in the company office when they need them. The USPTO has a program where its patent examiners work from home after their first-year. This allows its employees to live anywhere in the country and do their work. Working from home is a practice that works well for existing companies. I think more places that are able to should allow it.
