title: Google to Stop Spam Boxing Campaign E-Mails
---
From [The Washington Post](https://wapo.st/3Nzvl8l):
> According to a filing circulated with congressional offices and obtained by The Technology 202, Google is asking the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to weigh in on whether it can launch a program to shield candidatesâ€™ emails from some spam detection tools.

When I worked for campaigns e-mail deliverability was a big challenge. Lots of campaigns would buy and sell lists with each other. Recipients would then get unsolicited political email and mark it as spam. This predictably would convince the Gmail spam filter that political email is spam. The reality is most campaign email lacks good content or is poorly written. Campaigns are just pulling the arm of the slot machine to see how many donations they get, and so of course people nuke it. I do not think political campaigns should get special treatment here. They have not earned it.
