title: DevUtils Gives You All Your Handy Tools in One Package

When I started coding I would often have to convert and format things from one type to another. JSON would be scrunched together, dates would appear in weird “epoch time” format that meant nothing. So I was excited to discover [DevUtils](https://devutils.com) which takes many of the websites I found and later command line tools and aggregates them into one handy app.

### Why It Matters
Having all these tools in one app makes it easier to find and use them, rather than using a search engine every time I need to. Since the tool is installed locally I do not need to worry about sending sensitive text or information to third parties.
