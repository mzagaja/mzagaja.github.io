<p>Carnegie Mellon professor <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pausch/">Randy Pausch</a> was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and after being diagnosed with it gave a moving lecture at his school. It has now become an internet sensation, and if you have not gotten a chance to see it yet, I highly recommend sitting back and spending the hour to <a href="http://cmu.blip.tv/file/461472/">watch it</a>.</p>
