Over the past week or so I have been seeing people I follow on twitter tweet up a storm about the [Patent Innovation Act](http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3309?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+3309%22%5D%7D). Fred Wilson [wrote a good post on it at his blog yesterday](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2013/12/the-goodlatte-patent-bill.html). As always the discussion was worth reading as well. [Gigaom also has a summary](http://gigaom.com/2013/12/05/house-passes-innovation-act-325-91-a-small-solution-to-a-big-patent-problem/).

As someone who has listented to many podcasts I was happy to see the provision that would allow technology manufacturers to engage in litigation while litigation against users would be halted. Many of the blogs and tweets I have read from podcasters and mobile developers have lamented the threat of patent trolls and now this would allow Apple to step-in and defend them. Unfortunately for entrepeneurs, patent litigation is expensive and the threat of a lawsuit can cause them to have to pack their bags.

We still have some ways to go before the problem that patent trolls cause is tamed. However this is a good step and it appears that with the support of the White House and hopefully a passing vote in the Senate this will make the lives of entrepreneurs a little easier.
