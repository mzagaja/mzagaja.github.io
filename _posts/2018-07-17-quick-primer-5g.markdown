title: A Quick Primer on 5G

I really enjoyed this [Quick Primer on 5G](https://dani.town/dani/a-quick-primer-on-5g?ref=usvwidget):
>There is an increasing need for mobile data (the amount of mobile data used in the US is up 4x since 2014 and 40x since 2010) but the existing spectrum doesnâ€™t have enough bandwidth to support a lot of additional traffic. 5G will be on a new, uncongested spectrum at a higher frequency (higher frequency = the wavelength is shorter so signal travels faster).
