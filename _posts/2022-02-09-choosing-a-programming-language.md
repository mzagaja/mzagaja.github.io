Why are you still using Ruby? Canâ€™t we do this in Python? Why not try node? This would be easier in JavaScript. I want to try writing Go. Software developers are an opinionated bunch, and newer ones can be shy to learning new languages and frameworks. Experienced developers can be quick to try new tools. As a software engineer you will learn many languages over your career and should be open to this. However when you are a leader in an organization you need a technical strategy and your strategy should be consistency. Sticking with a language and framework until it hurts and building a deep well of expertise in it will almost always serve you better than trying new things.
