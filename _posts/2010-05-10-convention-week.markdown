This is the season for Democratic conventions in Connecticut. I will be serving as a delegate to the Judge of Probate Convention (a low key uncontested affair). I will also be serving as a delegate for John Larson, the Congressman I interned for in Washington DC.

Even though these are largely pro forma affairs I was impressed that the candidate for probate judge still called me to ask for my vote and tell me about his candidacy. Turns out he attended the law school I go to and he spent time to share some advice and wisdom. In a time where a lot of people in Connecticut politics are online, I think the phone call is truly one of the most powerful tools available to candidates for connecting with people. It's all a matter of caring.
