---layout: posttitle: Malloy Pulls Aheadtags: []comments: on---I know there is a diary about the senate results but wanted to discuss the implications in the Governor's Race.The latest Rasmussen Reports telephone survey of likely voters in the state finds Dan Malloy is now earning 44% support against GOP frontrunner Thomas Foley's 35%. Five percent (5%) prefer some other candidate, and 17% are undecided.Malloy picks up 42% of the vote when matched against Republican Lieutenant Governor Michael Fedele. The Republican gets 28% support, with 25% undecided. Four percent (4%) like another candidate.Ned Lamont posts a modest 36% falling behind 38% for Foley. Nine percent (9%) favor some other candidate, while 17% remain undecided.Lamont picks up 43% support to Fedele's 34%, with 4% looking to another candidate. Given that match-up, nearly one-in-five Connecticut voters (19%) are undecided.The survey of 500 Likely Voters in Connecticut was conducted on June 1, 2010 by Rasmussen Reports. The margin of sampling error is +/-4.5 percentage points with a 95% level of confidence. Also here is the trend:<img src="http://www.zagaja.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-o-matic/cache/9e224_screenshot20100603at725.png" /><img src="http://www.zagaja.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-o-matic/cache/9e224_screenshot20100603at721.png" />I know people were arguing before that money buys results, but I'm just not sure I'm seeing it here. Malloy was finally approved for his CEP grant today while Lamont has already burned through $1.78 Million. Also interesting to note Fedele (the CEP participating GOP candidate) jumping 6 points against Ned Lamont. &nbsp;
