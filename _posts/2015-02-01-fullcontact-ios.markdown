A while back I recommended CoBook for contact management and syncing on the Mac. They were acquired by FullContact and the other day they finally released [an updated iOS application](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fullcontact-better-contact/id579616837?mt=8).. This provides a gateway to easily sync your iCloud contacts over to your Google account. I also find the UI easier to use to update contacts. The only downside is it does not yet seem to have a mode where iCloud can be the canonical place where all your contacts live, and I am hopeful they fix this soon.
