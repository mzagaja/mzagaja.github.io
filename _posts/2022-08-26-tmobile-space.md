From [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/25/23320722/spacex-starlink-t-mobile-satellite-internet-mobile-messaging):
> T-Mobile says it's getting rid of mobile dead zones thanks to a new partnership with SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet, at an event hosted by T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert and Elon Musk. With their "Coverage Above and Beyond" setup, mobile phones could connect to satellites and use a slice of a connection providing around 2 to 4 Megabits per second connection (total) across a given coverage area.

A neat idea and huge competitive advantage. But a part of me wonders whether more customers would benefit from T-Mobile laying fiber and upgrading its existing infrastructure on land. I use Verizon’s prepaid plan and have also used T-Mobile’s test drive and while the mid-band ultra-connect network is incredible, the reality is T-Mobile still seems to have more dead zones than Verizon. Unfortunately Verizon seems to lack enough bandwidth to service all its users with existing equipment, even with 5G. I am constantly throttled on their plan.
