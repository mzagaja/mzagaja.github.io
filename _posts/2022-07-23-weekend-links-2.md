* [The Fallacy of AI Functionality](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.09511.pdf) is a well written critique of AI and AI critics. TL;DR: Too much effort is spent talking about the ethics of AI, and not enough on whether it actually works.
* [How Hertz Paid Accenture $32 Million for a Website That Never Went Live](https://www.henricodolfing.com/2019/10/case-study-hertz-accenture-website.html) is a good summary of an old dispute. It largely demonstrates the challenges and miscommunications that occur when a whole bunch of folks who are not proficient in software technology are involved in a software project. Lots of miscommunication, missed project deadlines, and finally lawyers.
* [Shapeshifting Robots Can Now Brush Your Teeth](https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/penn-dental-engineering-shapeshifting-microrobots-can-brush-and-floss-teeth) was a surprising and neat innovation. Unclear how it might look and manifest as a consumer device, but seems like a great tool for kids or folks that can’t or don’t like using existing methods.
* [When COVID Came for Provincetown](https://www.wired.com/story/provincetown-covid-delta-outbreak-response/) was a good case study in how to respond to a COVID outbreak the right way.
