A few days ago I watched the [YouTube interview of President Obama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbR6iQ62v9k). I thought that it was well done but apparently the mainstream news media did not. This lead to an [incredible rebuttal by Hank Green](https://medium.com/@hankgreen/holy-shit-i-interviewed-the-president-fa3e8fb44d16):

>I may be biased here, but I feel like there’s an actual and honorable goal in all of this. America needs to convince young people that there are good reasons to be civically involved. Millenials are soon to be the biggest hunk of the electorate and, if the mid-terms are any indication, they simply don’t care. And that shouldn’t be surprising since no one is connecting to them in the ways they connect with each other or talking about issues that matter to them from perspectives they can identify with.
