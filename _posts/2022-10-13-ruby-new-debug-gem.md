title: The Magic of Ruby's New Debug Gem

One of the best parts of updating to the latest version of the Ruby programming language is the new and improved [debug gem](https://github.com/ruby/debug). I find it easier to use than byebug and love that it utilizes syntax highlighting.

### You Can Use This with VSCode
Folks that develop in JavaScript may be familiar with using their text editor to debug. Ruby now can do this with [vscode-rdbg](https://github.com/ruby/vscode-rdbg). It can speed up your debugging process.

### Donâ€™t Forget syntax_suggest
In addition to using the new debug gem, Ruby 3.1 includes [syntax_suggest](https://github.com/ruby/syntax_suggest) which helps you easily find unmatched `do...end` statements.
