[Press Release from Gov. Malloy's Office](http://www.governor.ct.gov/malloy/cwp/view.asp?Q=536186&A=4010):

>Governor Dannel P. Malloy, joined by State Comptroller Kevin Lembo and Department of Economic and Community Development (DECD) Commissioner Catherine Smith, today signed Executive Order (EO) No. 38 to make information regarding certain economic assistance and tax credits used to recruit or retain businesses more accessible to Connecticut residents.

This is a big victory for Kevin Lembo who has been working to make state government more transparent. Kudos to the Governor for getting onboard with this. If you want to learn more about open government I suggest dropping by next month's [Civic Hack Night Meetup in New Haven](http://www.meetup.com/newhavenio/events/153694482/).
