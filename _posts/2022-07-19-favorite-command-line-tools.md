One of the best ways to become more efficient at using your computer and more effective as a coder is to [master the command line](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line). While using the included tools on MacOS is great, I now have a pile of [favorite extra tools I have installed on my machine](https://github.com/stars/mzagaja/lists/tools-i-use). Some highlights:
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) for managing app installations.
* [fish shell](https://fishshell.com) has a learning curve but provides lots of convenience features and is much easier to customize than the default zsh shell.
* [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) for quickly filtering YAML and JSON files.
* [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) for quickly searching for files across many directories.
* [tealdeer](https://github.com/dbrgn/tealdeer) for getting concise man pages that give useful examples.
* [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) for downloading video or audio from YouTube.
* [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org) for a higher compression than ZIP open source compression tool.
