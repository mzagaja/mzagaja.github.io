One of my most useful desktop applications on my Mac is [Soulver](https://soulver.app). It is a notepad that can do math. 

### Why It Matters
Many times you need to convert a time, aggregate expenses, or do other minor math tasks. This can involve putting calculations into Google or a calculator app then pasting them into a spreadsheet or note document. With Soulver you have Math and Notes in the same document, making it easy to see and make changes to your math in context.

### What I Use It For
* Figuring out split bills for the month.
* Comparing prices between two stores (including with unit differences)
* Time zone conversions. Way too many time zone conversions.
* Calculating my running training paces.
