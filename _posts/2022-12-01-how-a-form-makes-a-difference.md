From [the Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/articles/improving-lives-economic-mobility-opportunity):
> In 2018, after three years of prototyping, digesting 1,800 pages of federal and state regulations, prototyping again, and pilot testing, Michigan rolled out a new form. It is 80% shorter. Nine out of 10 applicants fill it out in 20 minutes or less. And it takes staff 42% less time to process.
