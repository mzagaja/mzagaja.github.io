title: iMovie on iPhone is Missing This One Key Feature
layout: post
---
I wanted to take the video clips I had from TED last week and stitch them into a vertical video for sharing on social media. Trying to do this with iMovie was my first idea, but it was not a great one. It does not support vertical video. Just horizontal, and odd choice for a video editing app that sits on your phone.

### Why It Matters
Creatively I do not want to be locked into the tools provided by Instagram or other social media applications when building vertical video. I want the freedom to share it on all platforms. I want to be able to pick music I own.[^1]

### The Hack
I learned from searching that I can edit my video horizontally, then rotate all my clips 90 degrees and save the result. Finally I can go into the iOS Photos app and rotate it again. Hacky, but effective.

### Other Things Missing from iMovie on iOS
* Video stabilization, it’s amazing to discover how shaky the video I recorded was.
* The ability to import music from my Apple Music subscription.


### What I’m Trying Next
Maybe the answer is [Apple Clips](https://www.apple.com/clips/)?

[^1]:Another bummer was discovering much of the music from Apple Music cannot be imported into an iMovie video as well.
