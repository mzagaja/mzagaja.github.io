title: The Power is in the Role Models
---
When people say something cannot be done one of the best ways to disprove that is to do it. Nowhere do I think this is more true than in the field of energy where organizations are fighting climate change. A few interesting role models that came across my desk this morning include:

1. [Apple is now globally powered by 100 percent renewable energy](https://www.apple.com/ca/newsroom/2018/04/apple-now-globally-powered-by-100-percent-renewable-energy/)
2. [Portugal ran on 100% renewable energy for a month](https://reneweconomy.com.au/portugal-reaches-100-renewables-ends-fossil-fuel-subsidies-32820/)

Articles like these remind us what is possible when we put our time and energy behind something.
