title: Maccy - The Open Source Mac Clipboard Manager
---
I was discovered recently to discover [Maccy](https://maccy.app) which is a free, lightweight, open source clipboard manager for Mac. A clipboard manager stores history of items that were in your clipboard and lets you quickly access them. Maccy works so well it feels like it shipped with the operating system. I just hope it does not get [abandoned like Hush](https://twitter.com/mzagaja/status/1541553400277618688?s=21&t=L9ymqexHNfzfVrhIc2a_Sw).
