title: I Was Hacked!

I still cannot figure out how it happened but somehow my twitter account was hacked and tweeted a single spam tweet. For this sin I lost about ten followers and was the target of the inevitable witticisms. Well just one:

The only recourse I had was to delete the tweet from my history, change my password, and review access by third-party apps. My theory is that one of these third-party sources was compromised and managed to push tweets out to my account. However to be safe I am changing all my accounts that used my twitter password. Thankfully I have a good password manager. If you are not using one already, I strongly recommend <a href="http://agilebits.com/products/1Password">1Password</a>. It allows me to carry my passwords with me anywhere and generate randomized secure passwords for all my accounts.
