Remember the controversy with UCONN Professor Ken Dautrich? The <a href="http://www.ctnewsjunkie.com/ctnj.php/archives/entry/uconn_report_on_rell_pollster/">report has been released</a>. Ultimately it appears that some state money was spent on some partisan political activity and they recommended some discipline for Prof. Dautrich. Based on the report it appears the professor at least made an attempt to keep things separate, but did not manage to actually do so. 

This just goes to show how difficult it is to avoid the appearance of corruption in such a small state where people with unique skill sets end up having to wear many hats. I'm sure the experience was valuable to the students, but it is important that we do not allow state resources to be used to unfairly aid incumbents.
