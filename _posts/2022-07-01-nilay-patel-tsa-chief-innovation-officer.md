title: Nilay Patel Interviews TSA’s Chief Innovation Officer
---
On the latest episode of the Verge’s Decoder Nilay Patel [interviews the TSA’s chief innovation officer](https://overcast.fm/+QLdsxpZRA). They cover a whole host of topics, but I appreciated Patel pressing them on Pre-Check, the awfulness of the experience in general, and having to trade surveillance for convenience. We get a few hints of things to come: better scanners, less restricted items, and maybe facial recognition. Patel does a great job of pushing the case for how many shoe bombers are there, really? And do we actually need to be dumping all our liquids?
