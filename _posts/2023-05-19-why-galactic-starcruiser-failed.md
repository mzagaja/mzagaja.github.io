title: Why Galactic Starcruiser Failed

In March of 2022 Disney opened an ambitious project called Star Wars Galactic Starcruiser. A little over a year later, it will close in September of 2023. This ambitious project was quickly lampooned for its premium price tag. The initial surge of demand seemed to prove the critics wrong, but the well of galactic voyagers dried up quickly, and Disney is mercilessly ending this project.

### Why It Matters
Disney and its Imagineering team set out to do something more ambitious than it had done before. Had it been successful Disney could have created a new market for immersive theater experiences with all its brands. Disney showed it was willing to try something new, even if it was not guaranteed to succeed, and should be commended for that.

### I Loved My Galactic Starcruiser Experience
As a long time Star Wars fan, having the opportunity to be a part of a story was fun. The staff provided an amazing level of service and the food was delicious.  Even without being a Star Wars fan my wife found it to be an enjoyable adventure.

### The Nails in the Coffin
* There is little to compare it to. 
* The high price point put it out of reach for many.
* It also made it a big risk if you were undecided.
* Only one storyline gave little incentive for return voyages.
