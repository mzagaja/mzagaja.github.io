Lots of great [analysis at the CT Mirror](http://ctmirror.org/2015/02/18/malloy-budget-cuts-social-services-higher-ed-raises-tax-revenue/). With a large portion of the budget going towards pensions and debt service we are paying a lot of today's tax money towards the prosperity enjoyed by the last generation. The Governor is on the track when he talks about investing in things like infrastructure. However, I think we all wish the economy were doing a bit better so these tough choices would not have to be made.
