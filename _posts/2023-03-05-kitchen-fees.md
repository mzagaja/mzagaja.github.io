title: Kitchen Fees are Junk Fees

A new trend I have noticed dining out is the [rise of the kitchen fee](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/03/04/business/future-restaurants-how-kitchen-fees-are-meeting-economic-moment/). While the rationale for the fee is reasonable, its implementation is unfair and deceptive to consumers. With no method to opt-out, it is false advertising, meant to lure consumers into thinking they will spend less than they are.

### Why It Matters
As the cost of running their establishment continues to grow, restauranteurs rightly need to increase their prices. Instead of being transparent about this, they are adding a note saying they will add a fixed percentage to your total bill. With no way to opt out of this fee, it is a hidden price increase and unfair and deceptive to consumers.
