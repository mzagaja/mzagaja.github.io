A [scary report from the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/climate/greenhouse-gas-emissions-2018.html#click=https://t.co/G6LPsPF12C):
>Greenhouse gas emissions worldwide are growing at an accelerating pace this year, researchers said Wednesday, putting the world on track to face some of the most severe consequences of global warming sooner than expected.

>Scientists described the quickening rate of carbon dioxide emissions in stark terms, comparing it to a “speeding freight train” and laying part of the blame on an unexpected surge in the appetite for oil as people around the world not only buy more cars but also drive them farther than in the past — more than offsetting any gains from the spread of electric vehicles.

As someone who spends lots of time working with data, I especially appreciate the data visualization with error bars later in the story. Very well done.
