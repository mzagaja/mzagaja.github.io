One of the more interesting parts of software updates are the unexpected bugs that pop-up when you use them. Lately I have had atrocious issues with anything connected via Bluetooth to my M1 MacBook Pro. Especially strange today was the introduction of a symptom that caused my AirPods to push more audio out of the left AirPod instead of the right one:

Originally I was concerned I was losing hearing in my right ear, but it appears I may be part of a fun psychological experiment or strange bug. This follows an issue where my music also randomly stops playing in the AirPods using either my iPhone or MacBook Pro.
