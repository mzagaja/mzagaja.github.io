title: A New Half Marathon Personal Record

Yesterday I ran the BAA Half Marathon and set a new personal record: 1 hour, 48 minutes, and 20 seconds. This unofficial finish time is 1 minute and 39 seconds faster than I was in 2018. After being benched for nearly a year and failing to meet or exceed any of my personal records pre-COVID, this feels fantastic.

### The Training Routine
Instead of merely trying shorter and longer runs, I used three types of runs:
* Easy runs of 5km-10km to do “Zone 2” training. The purpose here was to raise the heart rate at which I burn fat.
* Weekly long runs of up to 21km (full half marathon distance) to benchmark my pace and build my endurance.
* Intervals of quarter to half mile at high speeds to build strength.

### The Equipment
This year I’ve been running with the [Saucony Endorphin Speed 3](https://www.saucony.com/en/endorphin-speed-3-wide/53075M.html). It’s the only wide width plated shoe that I have found on the market. My previous favorite, the Nike Vomero, was long delayed.

I also switched to a [cellular Apple Watch Series 9](https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-series-9/) to avoid needing to use am armband. It’s way more comfortable and worth it.

### What’s Next
Maybe trying to set a new 5K record.
