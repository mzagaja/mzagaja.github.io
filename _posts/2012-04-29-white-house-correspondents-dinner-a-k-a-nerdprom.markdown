Last night I switched on the White House Correspondents' Dinner in the middle of President Obama's speech. Watching it last night I was less impressed with Obama's performance than with Jimmy Kimmel. However I did not realize how much I had missed, and also how much setup there was at the beginning. Without the context to build on the jokes the speech was just not as funny as when I watched it in its entirety this morning. The hot microphone setup at the beginning was hilarious. Definitely better than Kimmel's performance, so I embedded the video above.
