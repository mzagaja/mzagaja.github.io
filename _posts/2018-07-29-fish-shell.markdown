title: Fish Shell

For the past couple years I have been using mostly ZSH as the shell on my Mac because it has special features. However, over the weekend, I discovered and have been trying the [fish shell](https://fishshell.com). So Far using the fish shell has been enjoyable compared to using ZSH. It includes some of the features I really enjoy about ZSH but also has lots of features that quickly help you recall terminal commands or look up their documentation. It provides all its extra features by default. This was a big improvement from dealing with ZSH which required add-ones and configuration to fully expose its best magic.

As the fish site says, it works out of the box:
> fish will delight you with features like tab completions and syntax highlighting that just work, with nothing new to learn or configure.

While it is worth understanding bash, using a shell like fish on your personal machine can make life an inch easier as you engage in software development.
