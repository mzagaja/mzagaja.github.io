With the end of school coming up I have been pretty busy. I took the morning Saturday to volunteer at the Connecticut Democratic State Convention. It was an early morning, I woke-up at 6 a.m. and started helping out around 7 a.m. However it was fun and I got to see some old friends. The lull of posting will probably continue over the next week as I hustle to finish up my remaining papers for school but I wanted to share this video of Chris Murphy taking the stage and the beginning of his victory speech at the Democratic State Convention. The convention hall was emptying out by the time he gave it but it was a good speech.
