At my last DTC meeting our state central committee person brought to my attention the fact that there is a new delegate selection plan for the Democratic National Convention and we are currently in an open comment period. The plan is linked at the bottom of the <a href="http://www.ctdems.org">front page of the CT Dems website</a> or you can <a href="http://ctdems.org/sites/ctdems.org/files/2012ModelDelegateSelectionPlan.pdf">click here</a>. The website asks people to submit comments to info@ctdems.org. <br />
