- U2 is [being honored by the Kennedy Center](https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2022/11/28/u2-kennedy-center-honors/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9). Surprised to learn they already have an album made.
- For my Rubyists: [RSpec the bad parts from RubyConf](https://speakerdeck.com/calebhearth/rspec-the-bad-parts). Can’t wait to see the talk recording.
- Also for Rubyists: [In Defense of Metaprogramming](https://speakerdeck.com/noelrap/in-defense-of-metaprogramming). I have yet to be a fan, but maybe I’ll give it a try after this talk.
- [Ruby debug v1.7.0 is out](https://github.com/ruby/debug/releases/tag/v1.7.0) with a contribution from yours truly to make it work properly with my favorite text editor [Panic Nova](https://nova.app).
