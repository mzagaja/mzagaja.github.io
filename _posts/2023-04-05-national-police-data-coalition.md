Last night Darrell Malone returned to Code for Boston to bring back the [National Police Data Coalition](https://www.nationalpolicedata.org/) to our project portfolio. Originally born out of a [2019 National Day of Civic Hacking challenge](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uvlIs0Ru8NH7mWyzjg93if582O_DWkjcb24i83Dttss/edit#) the National Police Data Coalition is a now a non-profit working nationwide to establish a repository of police data.

### Why It Matters
National Police Data Coalition is Code for Boston’s third project in flight as we continue to grow in 2023. This equity focused initiative will create the first, national repository of police data. Initially focused on being of use to public defenders in conjunction with the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers they also plan to make the data usable for other purposes like allowing police departments to view history of their applicants.
