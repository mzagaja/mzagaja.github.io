Greg Wilson [links to an interesting academic paper from IEEE](https://neverworkintheory.org/2023/03/06/on-time-delivery-in-large-scale-agile.html):
> We find that factors such as requirements refinement, task dependencies, organizational alignment and organizational politics are perceived to have the greatest impact on on-time delivery, whereas proxy measures such as project size, number of dependencies, historical delivery performance and team familiarity can help explain a large degree of schedule deviations. We also discover hierarchical interactions among factors: organizational factors are perceived to interact with people factors, which in turn impact technical factors.

### Why It Matters
Correctly estimating and consistently delivering on project timelines is the white whale of software project management. Much has been written about it and estimations often turn into a tug of war between engineering and management. Being able to accurately and reliably model the forces at play can give organizations a fighting a chance at more accurately delivering on business priorities.

### The Mistakes I Repeatedly See
Having worked in software for a long time I see non-technical product managers make these mistakes over and over again:
* Insisting on a business priority that that costs more in technical work and complexity than it delivers in business value.
* Demanding the use of specific technologies; leave implementation up to the engineers and technical strategy to the engineering managers.
* Insisting something be done that is technically impossible or challenging.

* [Death March by Edward Yourdon](https://www.amazon.com/Death-March-2nd-Edward-Yourdon/dp/013143635X) outlines how to handle a project that is destined for failure.
