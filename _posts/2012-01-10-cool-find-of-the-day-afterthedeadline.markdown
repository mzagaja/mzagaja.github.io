Sometimes when I write blog posts they are not quite as polished as my regular writing. I tend to view it as a stream of consciousness and I'll sometimes go back and edit it a day or two later. However I recently discovered a neat tool called <a href="http://afterthedeadline.com/">After the Deadline</a> that can help provide some extra polish to that first or final draft. Not only does it check spelling but it also provides other hints and grammatical advice for your writing. WordPress provides it as a plug-in and you can also get it as a plug-in for Word or Google Chrome. They even have a website you can paste text from a word document into or an OpenOffice plug-in. It's worth the installation if you are a writer.
