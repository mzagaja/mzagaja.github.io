I love getting new gadgets as gifts, and thus was excited to play with the new [Elgato Key Light Mini](https://www.elgato.com/en/key-light-mini) I received yesterday. The improvement in quality for my webcam was dramatic.

Logitech C920 picture of me with an inexpensive Tautronics desk lamp I have been using for a few years:

New Elgato Key Light Mini:

This is using the brightness at only 10% (!) and a yellow color temperature.

### What I Like
* Connects to WiFi for control via [Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck-mk2).
* Lots of customizations for brightness and color temperature.
* Sturdy.
* Built-in battery for portable use.
* Diffuser makes having the light in the face less fatiguing.

### What Could Be Improved
* No included monitor mount. I used a command strip on top of my Logitech C920.
* WiFi setup with AirPort Utility on MacOS was a bit glitchy and took a few tries.

### Light Makes a Difference
Even if the room you are in has lighting above you, getting light on your face makes a big difference in camera quality. Buying something like the Key Light Mini can be a huge improvement over trying to buy a new webcam.
