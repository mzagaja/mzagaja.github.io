Instead of a long post I am sharing an eclectic collection of interesting links today:
<ul>
	<li>Clay Shirky <a href="http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2012/11/napster-udacity-and-the-academy/">wrote an essay</a> on the future of higher education. I think he neglects one issue: the enthusiasm gap. Online learning works great for people who are interested in learning. How do we make it work for the disinterested or people who just want a job?</li>
	<li>The New York Times had an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/18/business/as-boom-lures-app-creators-tough-part-is-making-a-living.html?hpw">interesting article</a> on app makers. It seems that the App Store on Apple's website has created downward price pressure on software which is good for consumers but is hurting developers. I think once the flush of venture funding for new apps dries up we'll see higher prices again. Free is not a sustainable model, and quite frankly most of the software I have paid for is much higher quality than the free stuff.</li>
	<li>The Atlantic had a <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/11/when-the-nerds-go-marching-in/265325/">fantastic article</a> on Harper Reed and Obama's technology team.</li>
	<li>If you have an iPhone I recommend downloading the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/duolingo-learn-spanish-french/id570060128?mt=8">DuoLingo app</a> if you are interested in learning or brushing up on a foreign language. It syncs and works with <a href="http://duolingo.com">their website</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.quora.com/">Quora</a> is a question and answer website. Right now it has lots of focus on technology and startup issues but they have sections for a large variety of things. They recently updated <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quora/id456034437?mt=8">their iPhone app</a>.</li>
	<li>Did you know GMail has <a href="http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=6594">keyboard shortcuts</a>? Try them out and see if they save you time.</li>
	<li>I recently picked up <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a> for code editing. I thought <a href="https://tutsplus.com/course/improve-workflow-in-sublime-text-2/">this tutorial</a> on Tuts+ was helpful. I am still learning the ropes but I think this might be a keeper. If you do not do web or software development this is probably not worth bothering with.</li>
</ul>
