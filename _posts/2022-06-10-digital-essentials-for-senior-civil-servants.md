The UK GDS published [a list of essential technology, digital, and data skills for senior civil servants](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-data-and-technology-essentials-for-senior-civil-servants/digital-data-and-technology-essentials-for-senior-civil-servants). Although authored with a government audience in mind, I think it can be applicable to any senior manager in an organization today. I especially appreciate the rich links with detailed information under each bullet point.
