This review is not going to do The Rosie Project justice. Graeme Simsion has a gift for writing, creating characters, and drawing you in. Not since reading The Martian have I picked up a piece of fiction and been unable to put it down. The Rosie Project is a rare book that anyone who does not object to reading will enjoy.

In this book Don Tillman, a genetics professor, goes on an adventure to help Rosie find out who her real father is. The story chronicles Don and Rosieâ€™s adventures in picking up DNA samples to accomplish their mission. Enjoyment of this book comes not from the suspense of finding the answer but the highs and lows of the journey. I am looking forward to the sequel!
