The guy who gained fame making <a href="http://www.xkcd.org/">xkcd</a> style comics in order to fundraise money for his state representative race is now running for Congress.

With this run he says he has an idea to change Congress and improve things for America. I am not sure what this idea is but <a href="http://blogs.pitch.com/plog/2010/06/sean_tevis_to_save_america_starting_with_kansas_2nd_district.php">there is a teaser</a> and it will supposedly be on <a href="http://seantevis.com/">his website</a> by Wednesday. The teaser makes it look like it might be some kind of online community effort similar to Organizing for America. However we'll have to wait for more...
