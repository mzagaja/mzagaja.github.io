title: Auto Select Ruby and Node Versions in Fish Shell
layout: post
---
I am a fan of [fish shell](https://fishshell.com) for my coding work. It has a lot of features that bash and zsh lack. However the tools I used to pick my Ruby and Node versions. This saved me typing every time I switch apps. Fortunately it was easy to write my own. I have [shared my configuration change on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/mzagaja/c7ec73fe84fd161dfee13facb9c17e11). Just drop the function files in your `~/.config/fish/functions` directory and then update your config file to source them using the template I linked.
