I won a gift certificate to one of the <a href="http://healthtrax.com">local gyms</a> at our law school's annual Public Interest Law Group auction last November. In college I enjoyed going to the gym on a daily basis but stopped after I moved home. I finally turned in the gift certificate over my winter break and started going. Working out is relaxing but can also get boring so I have been bringing my iPod and exploring podcasts. My current favorite is MSNBC's <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/msnbc-morning-joe-video/id284692282">Morning Joe</a>. I have a love-hate relationship with news programming and usually prefer reading my news but Mika and Joe do a great job of summarizing the stories of the day and providing witty banter.
