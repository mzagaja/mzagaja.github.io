Rather than write out a long post today I wanted to link to a bunch of interesting data related developments:

1. [IBM Watson released five new services to its developer cloud](https://developer.ibm.com/watson/blog/2015/02/04/new-watson-services-available/) - Speech to text, text to speech, visual recognition, concept insights, and tradeoff analytics. There are some fun mini-demos on the website but if you want to take advantage of visual recognition today one of the cool things you can do is upload a photo set to your [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com/) and search for unlabled images using text descriptions.

2. [The White House released an interim big data and privacy report](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/whitehouse_files/docs/20150204_Big_Data_Seizing_Opportunities_Preserving_Values_Memo.pdf)

3. [Lex Machina is using data and machine learning to help companies win lawsuits](http://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2015/02/02/stanford-bred-startup-uses-moneyball-stats-to-handicap-judges-lawyers/) - This software uses data from litigation to help attorneys ascertain what the most effective litigation strategies are. I think software like this can give new attorneys a leg up against more experienced attorneys who instinctively build this knowledge base over time.

4. [Planet Money investigated Amazon Mechanical Turk](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2015/01/30/382657657/episode-600-the-people-inside-your-machine) - If you need a large volume of data entered inexpensively then Amazon mechanical turk is probably the best solution. However many of the workers are not making much money from it.
