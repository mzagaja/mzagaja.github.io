I [previously wrote about Kagi](https://www.zagaja.com/2023/03/kagi-google-alternative/), a fast paid alternative to Google that searches more independent websites and does not have ads. I started paying for it, and boy have I learned a few things.

### The Average User Searches 200 Times a Month
Kagi claims the average user should be able to use the $5/month plan that provides 200 searches a month. I am not average. Barely a week into paying, my meter is up to 66 searches.

### Google Isn’t Just Search It’s a User Interface
I find that one reason for so many searches is a lot of the time I have been using Google Search instead of directly going to websites I use. The majority of programming answers I receive could probably be pulled from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com). It has a good search built in. I just tend not to use it. 

### A Better Experience
The big upside to using Kagi is the fact it de-prioritizes sites with lots of ads and trackers. This means when I search for random things, I’m less likely to click into content farms. This alone has been wroth the price.
