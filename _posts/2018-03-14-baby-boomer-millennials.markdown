Someone shared [this article](https://www.vox.com/2017/12/20/16772670/baby-boomers-millennials-congress-debt) with me today and I felt the need to respond in poem.

This analysis does nothing to undo our paralysis.
The author tries hard to assign blame, but has no idea how to win this game.
He can paint people with a large brush stroke, but has he even talked to regular folk?
This was nothing novel; it was more of the same.
If government debt is our frustration,
Our solution must be innovation.
