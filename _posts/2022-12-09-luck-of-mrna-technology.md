On Wednesday I went for my second COVID booster shot after a year. It has been three months since I have COVID, which I suffered through twice in 2022. The first time was not fun, but the second time was mild. My arm still hurts from the shot, but I am glad I was able to get it.

### Bivalent Boosters are Working Well
From the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7148e1.htm):
> Relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of a bivalent booster dose compared with that of ≥2 monovalent vaccine doses among persons for whom 2–3 months and ≥8 months had elapsed since last monovalent dose was 30% and 56% among persons aged 18–49 years, 31% and 48% among persons aged 50–64 years, and 28% and 43% among persons aged ≥65 years, respectively.

### By The Numbers
* Massachusetts leads the way with a [measly 25% of the population having received a bivalent booster](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-people-booster-percent-pop5). 
* [62.9% of the Massachusetts population that has gotten a flu shot](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/interactive-general-population.htm) so it’s not a fear of needles keeping folks from doing this.
* COVID cases have [risen 54% in the past 14 days](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/massachusetts-covid-cases.html). If more people had gotten a booster, this increase would be less.

### What’s the point?
The COVID vaccine and booster reduces but does not eliminate your chance of getting infected, but also does a **great job of keeping you out of the hospital**. COVID is a horrific disease that has killed a lot of people, but now we have a way to keep ourselves safe. A booster reduces disruption to our lives and reduces the spread of the virus.
