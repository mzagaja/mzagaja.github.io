title: The Sleep Experiment Part 2

After spending a week trying to increase the amount of sleep I get I have been unable to push myself to be in my bed for than seven and a half hours. However the difference between under and over seven hours feels like the world. Yesterday waking up with nearly six and a half hours was a bit of a struggle for the day. This morning I woke up with seven hours and twenty minutes and I feel great. I am not sure if I will ever successfully push eight hours, but today writing this blog post was easy, while yesterday I missed it.
