I've been a customer of <a href="https://home.ingdirect.com/">ING Direct</a> for a while. So I was really excited to discover that not only do they have an <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ing-direct/id329508084?mt=8">iPhone app</a> but the app lets you deposit checks using the phone's camera. It's pretty simple, you just take a picture of the front and the back of the check using the application and it uploads them to the bank. You wait two days and then the money is in your account. Friends had told me about this service with their bank which made me jealous, now I can say that I too have joined the 21st century. My only complaint is that the phone does not yet print cash.
