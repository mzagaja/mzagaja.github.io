If you are a Mac fan, [General Magic](https://www.generalmagicthemovie.com) was made for you. It tells the story of a company that spun off of Apple and built the world’s first smartphone, and that company’s failure. Many of the interviews are with characters that are familiar from the [Steve Jobs movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2080374/). It is available for purchase on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/general-magic/id1458835312) and [Tubitv](https://tubitv.com/movies/614633) is streaming it for free.
