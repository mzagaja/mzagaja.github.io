title: The Fault Programming Language

---
USDS alum [Marianne Bellotti](https://www.bellotti.tech/) just released [a new programming language for modeling using System Dynamics called Fault](https://github.com/Fault-lang/Fault). Happening upon this was a true throwback, as I learned about the field of[ System Dynamics as an undergrad at WPI](https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/social-science-policy-studies/graduate-programs/system-dynamics-systems-thinking). What a neat idea.

### A Fancier Excel Spreadsheet
At its core System Dynamics is a fancier and more formal version of Excel spreadsheets that most people might use to evaluate things like their monthly household budget. By specifying and modeling a system, the computer might reveal scenarios and challenges that you did not anticipate on your own.

### The Challenge of Modeling the Real World
As I have worked on data problems from software to campaigns one of the largest challenges remains trying to find your blind spots. A programming language like Fault can be a tool to reveal some of these. However it is not foolproof, if you do not account for all the factors in a system, you will still miss things. Caveat emptor!

### Fun to Play With
Given how simple this might be relative to other programming languages, and the accessible nature of being written in Go, checking out Fault might be a fun exercise for a software engineer. Give it a go, and see if you an find any bugs.
