[The best piece of writing on the 2018 Boston Marathon](https://www.runnersworld.com/news/a20087622/behind-the-scenes-of-desiree-lindens-incredible-boston-marathon-win/) I have read:
> A deluge of icy rain drenching the 26.2-mile route to Copley Square, the relentless 25-mph headwinds, and the temperatures hovering in the high 30s had already made the 122nd running of the prestigious road race historic. It was clear that 2018’s Boston had a late entrant to field: Mother Nature.

> What unfolded during the next two hours, 39 minutes, and 54 seconds wasn’t what Linden—or anyone else—expected. On her sixth try, haunted by the memory of losing this race by two seconds in 2011, the 34-year-old woman ran with doubt, in fear, and ultimately with unbreakable resolve down Boylston Street to become the 2018 Boston Marathon champion.
