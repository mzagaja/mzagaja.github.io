title: Donâ€™t Count on the South Boston 9 Bus on Weekends

This morning my wife was hoping to take the bus to an appointment and the bus never came. She ended up driving.

### Why it Matters
* South Boston is parking is competitive. If the neighborhood does not have reliable public transit, more people are going to buy cars making it worse.
* People with cars will use them more, polluting the city and releasing carbon into the atmosphere.

### By the Numbers
* According to the MBTA [the 9 bus has a 63% reliability rating over the past month](https://mbtabackontrack.com/performance/#/detail/reliability/2022-09-29/Bus/Other%20Bus/9/offpeak).
* On Sept 18, 2022 the 9 bus only arrived for 35% of its scheduled departure times.

### Look for Patterns
The least reliable time for the 9 bus is typically on weekends.
