title: Hiring Front-End Web Developer
---
My group at the Metropolitan Area Planning Council is [hiring a front-end web developer](https://www.governmentjobs.com/careers/mapc/jobs/2424687/front-end-web-developer?pagetype=jobOpportunitiesJobs). We currently have a team of three people including two full-stack developers and need someone that can help us with our front-end design and code. We hope to hire someone with design skills. While we sometimes work with a digital designer we have some lighter touch projects that could benefit from a person with just the right amount of design intuition. If you love visualizing data and building charts and data dashboards, this position could be a great fit for you. We want someone that can take our interfaces and visualizations from functional to fantastic. If your passions are JavaScript, CSS, and data then you will probably love working with us.
