The Killers played the TD Garden arena in Boston last night, and I loved every minute of it. The pyrotechnics and visuals were a great complement to the superb energy the band brought to the stage. This was one of the best concerts I have been to.

### The Highlights
* An audience member playing the piano during Dustland Fairytale.
* Laser lights and pyrotechnics.
* The energy of All These Things That I’ve Done

### The Cringe
Brandon Flowers referring to the event as a superspreader at the start. Too soon.
