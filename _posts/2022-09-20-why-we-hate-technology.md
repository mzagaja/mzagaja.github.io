title: Why We Hate Technology

Yesterday Sen. Chris Murphy[^1] [highlighted the disconnect between how Silicon Valley and America see technology](https://twitter.com/chrismurphyct/status/1571860780588634112?s=21&t=j7VB7Mn572ZRl98DAFpVdw). Murphy points out that constituents distrust technology. It overwhelms and vexes, with a feeling that we work for the technology instead of the technology working for us. This is a far cry from the [bicycle for the mind that Steve Jobs envisioned](https://youtu.be/ob_GX50Za6c?t=26). This thread foreshadows potential regulation, but before we regulate we should ask ourselves, why is technology perceived this way?

Many companies employ software in a detrimental or even hostile manner. Organizations are [making students and workers install surveillance tools that watch them](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/14/business/worker-productivity-tracking.html). Governments are [buying AI software that does not work properly](https://ainowinstitute.org/litigatingalgorithms.pdf). Companies are replacing customer service people who help us with robots that frustrate us. While the technologies might improve a metric for the organization they often inflict pain or even harm on the people that are forced to use them.

We can do better, and I believe there should be more regulation around the uses I describe above. However there are more reasons to be wary of technology and innovation to cover. Tomorrow, I will explore why software seems to fail us so frequently.
