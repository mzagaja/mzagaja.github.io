Friend of Code for Boston Anne Meeker [testified to the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress recently](https://modernizecongress.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/constituent-services-building-a-more-customer-friendly-congress). As a former Congressional intern many of her ideas and suggestions hit home. Congressional offices receive a lot of correspondence so her suggestion to create APIs and data standards around the correspondence is some great low hanging fruit. The clunky system I used from Lockheed Martin held a lot of data, but was not most usable. If you are a political or civic tech nerd, it is worth watching the full video.
