If you have not yet done so you should check out the <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/">Planet Money</a> reports on job creation. There is an <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/435/how-to-create-a-job">episode of This American Life</a> and <a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/05/ff_jobsessay/">an issue of WIRED magazine</a>. What I found interesting were the graphics that noted Hartford as an epicenter of jobs for the aerospace, automotive, communications, and electrical equipment industries.

On a side note I downloaded the issue on my iPad and was rather impressed with WIRED's iPad application. In addition to the regular magazine content there were infographics that came to life and it included a <a href="http://fora.tv/2011/05/03/Planet_Moneys_Adam_Davidson_Smart_Jobs">video presentation on the research that Adam Davidson made at a WIRED conference</a>.
