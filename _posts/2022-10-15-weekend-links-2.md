* [Warren, Markey put MBTA in hot seat over safety incidents](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/10/14/metro/senator-warren-hold-rare-congressional-hearing-boston-friday-mbta-safety-problems/) summarizes Friday’s Congressional hearing on MBTA safety in Boston. Our senators did not hold back.
* [Code for America Brigade Congress](https://discourse.codeforamerica.org/t/brigade-congress-2022-schedule/1506) is this weekend. Both in-person and virtual options. I am sad to miss it, but presenting virtually on Sunday.
* More [information on student loan relief is out](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/debt-relief-info). You can qualify based on 2020 or 2021 income. A surprising but big win for folks who job hopped during COVID.
* The [Meta Quest Pro 2](https://www.meta.com/quest/quest-pro/) was unveiled. It’s a neat looking piece of technology, but maybe still more expensive and too low of a battery life than most people would accept.
* [Is software engineer an engineer?](https://news.slashdot.org/story/22/10/14/221214/is-a-software-engineer-an-engineer-alberta-regulator-says-no-riling-the-provinces-tech-sector) A Canadian Province says no. There currently is not a path to become a licensed software engineer in most jurisdictions, but I do think there should be.
