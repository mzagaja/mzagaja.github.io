* [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/) is a great assistant for writing prose. I like it because itâ€™s more open source than Grammarly.
* [Kara Swisher interviews Mark Cuban @ Code Conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAimY3BY8cI)
* [Splatoon 3 for Nintendo Switch passes 3 million sales in Japan](https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/09/japanese-charts-splatoon-3-closes-in-on-3-million-copies-sold). I finished the fun single player campaign and still believe this is one of the best games for the Switch.
* [Kaleidoscope App](https://kaleidoscope.app/release-notes) is my favorite tool for comparing code files. They just released a new version with great features for sharing diffs and working with JSON.
