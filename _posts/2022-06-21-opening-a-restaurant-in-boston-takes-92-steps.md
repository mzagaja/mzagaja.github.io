title: Opening a Restaurant in Boston Takes 92 Steps
---
From [Inc.](https://www.inc.com/victor-w-hwang/institute-of-justice-regulations.html)
> Opening a barbershop takes 81 steps in Boston, 68 in Atlanta, and 66 in Jacksonville, Florida. Opening a bookstore takes 74 steps in Newark, New Jersey, 46 in Atlanta, and 44 in Indianapolis, New Orleans, and Seattle. How much protection does the public need from a bookstore? What would be the public harm if there were too many?
