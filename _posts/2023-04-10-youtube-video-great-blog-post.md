title: When a YouTube Video Would Make a Great Blog Post
layout: post

Lately it seems as if many fifteen minute YouTube videos would be fantastic short blog posts. I am interested in what the speaker has to say, but don’t want to sit through the “please like, subscribe, etc.” pitch and meandering background information designed to pad their video length. Enter the [Kagi Universal Summarizer](https://kagi.com/summarizer/index.html).

### Why It Matters
You can save time and avoid the work of scrubbing through a video for a main idea with this AI tool. Feed the summarizer your YouTube URL link and it spits out a paragraph with the answer to the clickbait title. Want to go deeper? Ask it to give you “key moments”. 

### From Podcasts to Long Articles the Summarizer Works with Nearly Everything
You will never get the full flavor of a piece of content from the summarizer, but it works with a variety of media. In an era where lots of content lacks useful descriptions or employs clickbait, this saves you time.

### What’s Next?
I hope for an extension/shortcut that can quickly take a website or video I am looking at and put it through this tool. Maybe integrated into my operating system.
