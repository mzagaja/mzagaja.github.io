An interesting analysis from An Xiao Mina in an [article on Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/90259343/trump-has-twitter-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-is-winning-instagram):

> What’s striking about Ocasio-Cortez’s style is just how digitally native it seems. Sprinkled with emoji, cute stickers, hand-drawn illustrations on top of content, colorful fonts, and not a small number of selfie videos, she embraces all the affordances of Instagram. On Halloween night, for instance, she started up a live stream while she prepared ramen in an Instant Pot. As she chopped up vegetables, she answered questions from her followers about her thoughts on politics and the midterms. A portion of the video used the VCR filter, which created a grainy image along with a timecode, and she then posted the results of her meal (yes, it looked tasty), along with a recipe on her Pinterest account.

The thing I find most interesting about this is how effective she is at it. Other politicians like Chris Murphy have been doing their own Snapchat account for a while, but people seem particularly stricken by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s social media presence. Given that this is not the first time a politician has used social media in this way, I tend to think the excitement about it is more a function of the content creator than the medium.
