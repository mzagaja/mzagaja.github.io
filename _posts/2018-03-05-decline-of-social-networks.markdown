title: The Decline of Social Networks
---
Up until a few months ago my primary outlet for writing has been on Facebook. Facebook provides a great user experience and importantly to me has an integration with the sharing features in macOS and iOS. This made it easy to copy a quote from an article I found and link it to my friends so they could get a glimpse into my own thinking. Unfortunately due to recent changes in the news feed and maybe the progression of life, it feels like Facebook is turning into a ghost town. I find myself spending more time on Twitter.

While I do not dislike Facebook and other social networks as much as some people, I have decided that in the long run it is better to [own my content](http://avc.com/2018/01/owning-yourself/). Going forward I will talk more about [my work](http://www.mapc.org/) and my experiences at [Code for Boston](http://www.codeforboston.org/) along with interesting writing and videos that I find.
