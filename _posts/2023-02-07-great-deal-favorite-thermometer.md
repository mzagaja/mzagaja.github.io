title: A Great Deal on my Favorite Thermometer

Thermoworks is [closing out their original ThermoPop line in favor of a new model](https://www.thermoworks.com/thermopop/). I picked one up a few years ago after my mom recommended it. I use the thing all the time. It is easy and accurate. Being able to check the temperature of cooked meats is a huge improvement over guessing, as is doing the same for oil when I pan fry things. I even can use it to check the temperature of air coming out of my HVAC vents. A steal for you or easy gift at $15.99.
