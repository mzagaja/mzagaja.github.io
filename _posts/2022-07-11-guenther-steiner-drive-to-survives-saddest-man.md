title: Guenther Steiner - Drive to Survive’s Saddest Man
---
From [Vulture](https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/f1-removing-mgu-h-for-2021-engines-a-backwards-step-mercedes-5319162/5319162/):
> And then there’s Guenther Steiner, inarguably the saddest character on Drive to Survive. As the principal for Haas, a team that routinely contends for last place since its inception, he stars in what is clearly the most unflattering narrative in the series: the perennial loser fighting for the smallest of victories. Steiner-centric episodes are exercises in Sisyphean struggle; as portrayed across the docuseries, the Haas drivers frequently underperform or bear the extreme brunt of bad luck. The team’s plight was encapsulated by a phone call caught on tape in the first season in which Steiner grumbles to the team owner in his thick Merano accent, “We look like a bunch of fucking wankers.” 

After this [weekend’s race result](https://www.formula1.com/en/results.html/2022/races/1115/austria/race-result.html) with both Haas drivers receiving points for the second week in a row, we may finally be seeing an opening for a redemption arc in the next season.
