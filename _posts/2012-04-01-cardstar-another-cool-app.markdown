I first used <a href="http://www.mycardstar.com/">CardStar</a> a year or two ago when I first purchased my iPod Touch. However after I got sick of carrying both the iPod and my Blackberry around it fell out of use. When I upgraded to an iPhone 4S the app was there but I never felt compelled to set it up again. My loyalty cards sat in an unused stack on my desk (along with the business cards). When I opened the app for the first time in over a year yesterday, I was pleasantly surprised to find they added in a bar code scanner feature with the camera. Instead of having to type in each number I could just scan them with my camera and it would add them in. In under five minutes I had all my cards added and life was made easier. It seems a little weird to scan the bar codes off the phone screen at first, but it works.
