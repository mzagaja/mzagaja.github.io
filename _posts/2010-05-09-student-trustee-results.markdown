<p>Just wanted to share a copy of the e-mail I sent out about the student trustee election results (below the split).</p>
<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>I was waiting for an official announcement to be sent before I sent<br />
this but since it seems that may not happen I wanted to inform you<br />
that Adam Scianna (a Civil Engineer at Storrs) won the Graduate<br />
Student Trustee election. I want to express my sincere gratitude to<br />
everyone that supported me, voted, and sent kind words. It meant a lot<br />
to me and I enjoyed the opportunity to hear your stories and concerns<br />
about our school as I campaigned. While I will not have the<br />
opportunity to tackle these as student trustee, I will continue to<br />
stay involved in other ways.</p>
<p>As always you should feel free to contact our competent and hard<br />
working SBA representatives if you have problems or suggestions for<br />
things on campus. They work hard for you and I know they are more than<br />
happy to try and address problems or suggestions you might have.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Matt</p>
