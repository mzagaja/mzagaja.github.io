Over the past week I have been working on relaunching [vote.ctnewsjunkie.com](https://vote.ctnewsjunkie.com). This side project is a love note to the idea that candidates should share their positions on their issues with their constituents when they go up for election. Seasoned [CTNewsJunkie](https://ctnewsjunkie.com) journalists develop a questionnaire that we then email to all the candidates running for office. Over the next few weeks we will be reminding candidates to fill out their survey and sharing out their responses.

This innovative piece of work has been made possible by the support of the AARP. Despite some of the struggles with getting participation, they have continued to encourage us to pursue this. I am grateful they continue to believe in it.

I am also excited that Ben from [NewHaven.io](https://newhaven.io) has come onboard to help take over some of this project. It is much more fun and less work to do these things with a little help from some colleagues.
