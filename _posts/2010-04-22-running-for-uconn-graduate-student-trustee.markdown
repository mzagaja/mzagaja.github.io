<p>Every two years graduate students at the University of Connecticut are given the opportunity to vote for someone to represent them on the <a href="http://boardoftrustees.uconn.edu/">Board of Trustees</a>. The Board of Trustees is the governing body of our university and the last word on university policies, procedures, and tuition.</p>
<p>I want to serve as an advocate for graduate students across Connecticut. As an undergraduate I spent four years advocating for students as the founder of the Worcester Polytechnic Institute College Democrats. As President of the College Democrats of Massachusetts, I was responsible for fund raising, building relationships with other organizations, getting students resources, and successfully obtained representation for our group on the Democratic State Committee â€” the â€œboard of trusteesâ€ for the state Democratic Party. In one year I transformed our group into a well respected political organization in the state of Massachusetts.</p>
<p>I will work to build a community of engagement. I pledge to hold office hours on all the graduate student campuses across Connecticut. I also pledge to work with all graduate student governments. I will provide you with updates regularly and remain accessible via phone, e-mail, facebook, and yes, even twitter.</p>
<p>I am concerned with ensuring that all the campuses across the state have their interests represented equally. I am concerned about tuition increases that outpace inflation. I am concerned when I see our state taking <a href="http://www.ctnewsjunkie.com/ctnj.php/archives/entry/op-ed_the_terrible_consequences_of_executive_failure/">$23 Million</a> from our operating reserve account to cover a budget gap. Some of these issues are bigger than what happens in the boardroom â€“ to that end, I promise to advocate for our schools both at Storrs and the state capital.</p>
<p>Please feel free to share your ideas and concerns with me. You can e-mail me or contact me via <a href="http://www.facebook.com/mzagaja">facebook</a>.</p>
<p>I respectfully ask for your vote next week (<a href="http://www.vote.uconn.edu/" title="http://www.vote.uconn.edu/">http://www.vote.uconn.edu/</a>). If I am elected I promise that I will do my best to ensure that UCONN remains an institution we are all proud of.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Matt</p>
