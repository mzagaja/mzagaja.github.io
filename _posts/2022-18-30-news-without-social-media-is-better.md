title: News Without Social Media is Better

As I have been scaling back my usage of twitter one of the things I have discovered is reading online news without social media is better. By not wasting time on links to sites with pay walls I get right to the story. Many of the opinion peddlers on twitter were working to monetize their writing on places like Substack. Sometimes their perspectives were interesting or insightful, but I do not miss them.

### Paywalls Are Not Sustainable
Paying for a subscription to a service with a lot of content like The New York Times or Washington Post can make sense. $100 a year is a reasonable price for this. Paying for every person’s newsletter is not. Just because that one Wall Street Journal article is interesting does not mean I want to read every article there. The web has developed a great model for paying for a subscription, but not for an issue or article. With [Apple Pay](https://stripe.com/payments/apple-pay) it should be easy to implement single payments for articles, but nobody seems to do this.

### Social Media Trends are Reported on by the Traditional Media
Journalists love social media, and they will write-up the latest trends on twitter, TikTok, and other sites. The New York Times and The Verge both [cover trending topics](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/27/business/tiktok-office-influencers.html) within a day or so of them rising to the top of social media. You can stay in-the-know without the outrage or time wasting by simply keeping an eye on your regular news sites.

### What is Hard to Replace
* Updates from live events — if it does not have a liveblog or livestream then social media is often the only place to read about it.
* Discovery — modern blogs and websites have fallen out of the habit of linking to each other. Bill Hunt [has a great suggestion to fix this](https://billhunt.dev/blog/2022/11/28/weaving-the-web/).
* Feedback — unless someone emails me or has their own blog I follow, I do not get feedback. I am not sure if I want to commit to adding Disqus or other comments to the blog.
