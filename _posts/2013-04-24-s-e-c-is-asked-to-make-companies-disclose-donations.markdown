For reformers disclosure laws are a favored method of combatting potential campaign corruption. I think it helps, but recent prosecutions and scandal seem to suggest it does not prevent it. The concerns about chilling speech are likely overblown. Years into disclosure requirements for individuals we continue to see more people participate in the system, not less.
