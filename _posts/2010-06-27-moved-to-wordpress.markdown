After reading about <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/">WordPress 3.0</a> and discovering how many more features it has (including an <a href="http://blackberry.wordpress.org/">application for Blackberry</a>) I decided to ditch Drupal and move my website over. The process was fairly painless, especially using the one click installer from my new webhost, <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/">Dreamhost</a>. The process included deciding on a new theme template. I will probably stick with this theme for now until I have time and creativity to design something of my own.
