Tomorrow is Election Day so it is important to vote if you have not. I used to work in politics and have been following the election with some anxiety as a Democrat. The [forecasts](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house) [suggest](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/?cid=rrpromo) the Republicans are headed for a red wave. Meanwhile [TargetSmart suggests the Democrats are turning out the early vote](https://targetearly.targetsmart.com/g2022?view_type=SenateBS). In the end the only poll that matters it eh one on Election Day, so do not forget to vote.
