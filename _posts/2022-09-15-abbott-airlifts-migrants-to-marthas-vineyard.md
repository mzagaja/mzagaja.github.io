From the [Vineyard Gazette](https://vineyardgazette.com/news/2022/09/14/planeload-venezuelan-refugees-arrive-marthas-vineyard-airport):
> “We’re immigrants,” said Eliase, who said he was from Venezuela. “We came here because of the situation in our country, for the economy, for work, for lots of things. I came here walking. We went through 10 different countries until we got to Texas. There a refugee association put us in a plane and told us there would be work and housing here. I feel good, despite everything. We spent four days in Texas so it’s good to be here."

It is irresponsible to be sending folks to an island part of the Commonwealth that does not have as many resources to quickly respond to this, but great to see how quickly the island rallied. The Massachusetts Tourism Commission should ask permission to use “We just spent four days in Texas so it’s good to be here.” as its new slogan.
