One of my favorite things to do is read long form articles using the app [Instapaper](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instapaper/id288545208?mt=8&uo=4&at=11l74i) on my iPad or iPhone. I went through all the articles that I liked in Instapaper and picked out some of my favorites to share below. Enjoy!
