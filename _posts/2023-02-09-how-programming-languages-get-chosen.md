title: How Programming Languages Get Chosen
layout: post

Working on Urban League Heat Pump Accelerator at Code for Boston new folks often ask me, why did you pick Ruby on Rails? I can easily expound upon my love and the advantages of the Ruby programming language. However it is an invitation to a dead-end argument about the merits of languages. So I give the real reason: I know Ruby better than any other language, and nobody with experience in a different language was willing to raise their hand and commit to leading the backend group. Ruby won not on its merits, but by the dedication of one of its disciples.

### Why It Matters

For all the handwringing about the inherent advantages of certain languages, the on the ground reality is they are often chosen based on someoneâ€™s own excitement and familiarity.  A welcoming community, great documentation, and worthwhile conferences are going to do a lot of work in encouraging the adoption of a programming language and libraries. No wonder the New Relic folks spend so much money putting on well done training events.
