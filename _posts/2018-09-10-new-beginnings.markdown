title: New Beginnings
---
While autumn does not technically begin until September 20th, in my mind it starts after Labor Day. After years of going to school I have come to associate September with new beginnings. This year the new beginning involves the departure of my manager at [MAPC](https://www.mapc.org/). 

My friends cheekily sent me this tweet:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I no longer have a manager. I can&#39;t be managed</p>&mdash; KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) <a href="https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/989142253468708864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 25, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Change is bittersweet, however. The certainty and stability that existed with knowing how my current manager works is now gone. It will likely take a little bit of time for the team to settle into some new rhythms. At the same time we are [looking for a new manager](https://www.governmentjobs.com/careers/mapc/jobs/2199622/digital-services-manager). I am excited at what skills and experience a new manager might bring to the position and how it might shape the future of our team. The fun part about being in a small team is that each person can have a big impact on how things work. So if you are reading this and want to chat about working at MAPC, [drop me an email](mailto:mzagaja@mapc.org).
