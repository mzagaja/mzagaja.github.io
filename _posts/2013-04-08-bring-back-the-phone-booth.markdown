After looking at <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/foursquare-slideshow-2012-8#next-to-it-are-these-cool-british-style-phone-booths-23">some pictures of the Foursquare offices</a> on Business Insider it made me realize that the world suffers from a new problem: a lack of private spaces to take phone calls. This leads to people taking their phone calls in public or inconvenient places and the rest of the world learning the private details of their conversations. If you are in an office or school your options for taking a phone call are limited: a public space, a conference room, or go outside. To solve this I think it is time to bring back the phone booth.
