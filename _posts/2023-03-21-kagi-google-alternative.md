title: Kagi is the First Good Alternative to Google

A friend recommended I try [Kagi](https://kagi.com) and I am impressed. I have previously tried search engines like Bing and DuckDuckGo and have found them lacking. I have always returned to Google. I am not feeling the same pull with Kagi.

### Why It Matters
It has been a while since a real competitor to Google has emerged. Given the decline in quality of Google search results, it is frustrating. Maybe Kagi’s features will push innovation in this otherwise dead space.

### What Kagi Has
- Its own search result database.
	- Our searching includes anonymized requests to traditional search indexes like Google and Bing and vertical sources like Wikipedia, DeepL, and other APIs. We also have our own non-commercial index (Teclis), news index (TinyGem), and an AI for instant answers.
- The ability to up or downvote sites in results.
- [Lenses](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/lenses.html) to customize your results.

### The Downsides
- Including Google and Bing results seems like a risk. If Kagi’s results heavily rely on these, it could rapidly decline if Google figures out how to block these.
- You get 100 searches for free then have to pay for it. Yet another monthly subscription.
- There is no way to submit sites to their own index for crawling.
