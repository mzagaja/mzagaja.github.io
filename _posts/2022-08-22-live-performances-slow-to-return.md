We have had similar reflections at [Code for Boston](https://www.codeforboston.org) which has stubbornly remained below pre-pandemic participation. A survey we sent out to membership pinpointed commuting as the largest barrier to participation. Folks were willing to travel for a special [demo night event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTnIsy5CXAo&list=PLKHKcSbTn_eo8BIE_qLoS2B-AP7swqXWK), but the weekly event has been a tougher sell. The fact folks are not merely dropping in after a day at the office means it’s a tougher sell. If folks are going to commute you need to have a higher quality and more interesting event than just some drinks and pizza.
