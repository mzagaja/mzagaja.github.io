This tweet went viral and understandably shocked some folks in my generation. From manuals to e-mail written communication has been a bedrock of communication for us. As someone who prefers written to verbal and video communication it highlighted a reality I have been noticing for a while: the written word is losing.

Nowhere is this more evident than YouTube. A lot of content that would make great blog posts are now twenty minute videos on their platform. I find myself looking for the answers to things on YouTube and perusing the automated transcripts or playing videos at high speed. If you want to really see the difference [compare the GameFAQs content for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/switch/200276-mario-kart-8-deluxe/faqs) to the [videos for it on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Mario+Kart+8+deluxe+strategy).

This shift does not negate the advantages of the written word. It is more durable, easier to skim, and simpler to index and search. I also experience greater retention and comprehension when using written material versus videos, and doubt I am alone. I am using this shift to try and convert important written stuff into videos using tools like recorded Keynote presentations for others, but as a consumer, written will always win for me.
