If you are reading this post on my blog you are one of the few. Currently most of my updates are posted to Facebook and I will tweet interesting things on twitter. I think the reason for this is that the state of the open web regressed after the death of Google Reader. When Google Reader was popular many people used it. They'd stumble upon an interesting blog, add it to their Google Reader, and when you posted an update the magic of RSS sent a swarm of subscribers to your blog. While RSS readers still exist I think that their usage is down overall. This has lead many blogs and online shops to resort to e-mail newsletters as their tool to keep people updated and engaged. Unfortuantely, the quality of my inbox has steadily declined as a result.

So this lead me to wonder what could make blogging useful again. The first thing would be for it to be easy to post to my blog the way it is from Facebook using the share tools on iOS and OS X, both of which I use frequently. The second would be for people to use RSS readers again, or for Facebook to integrate RSS into its newsfeed. Finally it would be great if my Facebook posts could automatically post to Jekyll if they met certain criteria.

Meanwhile I am on the hunt for a good iOS and OS X GitHub Pages/Jekyll client to change some habits since I do not know how long Facebook will last, but I can be fairly certain this blog will.
