title: My Guy Announces his Candidacy
tags: []
---
Over the summer I was fortunate enough to get to work for <a href="http://www.danmalloy.com">Dan Malloy</a>'s exploratory committee. Today I got to see him announce his candidacy in Hartford. Dan's pitch is simple and compelling: he successfully ran Stamford and therefore has the experience needed to be successful in running Connecticut.

Dan is also participating in the Citizens' Election Program. This program requires candidates to collect small donations from a large number of donors in order to get a grant to run their campaign with. This allows candidates to not feel indebted to large donors and spend more time talking to people instead of raising money. As a result the field of candidates for governor this year is larger than 2006.

To learn more about Dan check out <a href="http://www.danmalloy.com">his website</a> or just ask me.
