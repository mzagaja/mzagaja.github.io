title: Making Technology Work for Us

Technology is inherently neutral. Tools like hammers and knives can be used to help or hurt. Automation can assist or hinder. The web has the ability to connect or divide us. Technology does not have a viewpoint, it just is.

The promises and perils of technology come from the people that wield it. Organizations can hire under qualified engineers with no plan to train them to give us poor quality software. Cynical executives can replace helpful customer service workers with useless robots. Grifters can post misinformation on social media to gain likes and influence. Distrusting leaders can employ surveillance to watch their employees every move. Just because something can be done or is even commonly done does not make it a good idea.

Technology has made many aspects of our lives better. It has the potential to improve wellbeing and happiness. However it needs responsible stewards. Missteps and mistakes can be forgiven when an organization operates at a small scale. As they grow, their responsibility to society grows with it. If Silicon Valley does not ask itself whether it is making the right choices, it certainly should be asked about them in the United States Senate.
