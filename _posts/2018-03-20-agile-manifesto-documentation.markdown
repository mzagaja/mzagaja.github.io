title: The Manifesto for Agile Software Development
---
Last night I asked a friend about his organizationâ€™s approach to software documentation and he told me they follow [the Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org). I did not quite understand what he meant but then he reminded me to look at the beginning:

> We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

> Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
> Working software over comprehensive documentation
> Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
> Responding to change over following a plan

I have come to especially appreciate the first part. My experience has taught me the tools matter very little compared to people using them.
