After mentioning that I had difficulty sharing a good twitter conversation earlier I discovered a tool called Storify. I figured I'd try it out for this post because I asked a reporter from the Hartford Courant for suggestions on some hidden gems and got some good links. Much thanks to <a href="http://courantblogs.com/capitol-watch/">Daniela Altimari</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/MaraLeeCourant">Mara Lee</a> at the Hartford Courant for their suggestions!
