Recently one of my friends asked what app I was using for calculation and I replied [Soulver 3](https://soulver.app). This not well known enough Mac only app makes it easy to combine calculations with context.

### What I Use It For
* Divvying up monthly expenses
* Figuring out running paces for my training plans.
* Price Unit Comparisons

### Plus Easy Export Options
Here is an example of calculations I did for items at Costco v. CVS or Target:

#### Costco Price Comparisons

CVS ProGlide Razors: ($26.49 × 1.5 / 8) = $4.97
Costco Razors: $52.99/16 = $3.31
Target Razors: $47.99/12 = $4.00

CVS Floss: $12.49/3 = $4.16
Target Floss: $13.39/3 = $4.46
Costco Floss: $14.99/6 = $2.50

CVS Oral B Toothbrush Head: $27.99/3 = $9.33
Costco Toothbrush Head: $39.99/9 = $4.44
Target: $19.94/3 = $6.65

CVS Toothpaste Colgate Total: $5.59 = $5.59
Costco Colgate Total: $9.99/5 = $2.00
Target: $2.59/unit = $2.59

Amazon Jet Dry: $14.57/32oz = $0.46/oz
Costco Jet Dry: $11.79/32oz = $0.37/oz
Target Jet Dry: $11.89/23oz = $0.52/oz

CVS Suave Shampoo: $6.79/28oz = $0.24/oz
Kirkland Shampoo + Conditioner: ($9.99 × 2)/(33.8oz × 2) = $0.30/oz
