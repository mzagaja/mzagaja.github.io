Today I added a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> license to this blog. While you might not be familiar with Creative Commons if you've used a website such as flickr to host your images you may have already have encountered and even used it. The license I chose gives permission to freely use the content as long as proper attribution is made. There may be little to take and remix now but maybe in the coming year I will write an interesting post you want to build on or finally learn how to make the next viral video. If you are interested in more information just check out the <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons website</a> or click "read more" to see a video from Prof. Lawrence Lessig explaining the importance of Creative Commons.
