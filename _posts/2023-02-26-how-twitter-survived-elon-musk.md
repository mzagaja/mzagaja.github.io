title: How Twitter Survived Elon Musk

In late October 2022 Elon Musk bought twitter. He started by mercilessly firing and laying off staff. He recklessly [tweeted conspiracy theories](https://www.npr.org/2022/12/14/1142666067/elon-musk-is-using-the-twitter-files-to-discredit-foes-and-push-conspiracy-theor). [Advertisers decamped the platform](https://www.npr.org/2022/11/25/1139180002/twitter-loses-50-top-advertisers-elon-musk). Some folks concerned about harassment, misinformation, and other issues left for Mastodon. Many folks were writing obituaries for twitter, but I logged in yesterday and found it alive and kicking.

### Why It Matters
Social networks live and die by the vote of the feet of their members. Despite a rich market of alternatives from Mastodon to Facebook, a large chunk of folks stayed on twitter. This is not an endorsement of Elon Muskâ€™s political views nor personal habits, but certainly a sign that his decisions from a business perspective were right.

### By the Numbers
* 2.5 million number of active Mastodon users at the end of December 2022.
* 1.4 million is the number of active Mastodon users at the start of February 2023.
* [368 million is the number of active users twitter claimed to have at the end of 2022](https://www.thurrott.com/cloud/social/279094/mastodon-continues-to-lose-users).

### What I am Seeing
A lot of folks hedged their bets and opened Mastodon accounts in 2022. Predictably there is a robust group of folks interested in Ruby (the language Mastodon is written in) along with Apple products. Independent app developers started making nicer Mastodon clients. Most brands and many people I was interested in following did not bother with Mastodon. I tried following Formula 1 related content and hashtags on Mastodon over the weekend and it was crickets, mostly bot mirrors of official accounts.

### What Mastodon is Missing
* Official brand accounts. There are some, but not nearly as much as twitter.
* Search and discovery. Mastodon has [its own norms and rationale for kneecapping search](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/594), but until it figures out how to funnel users to the content they want, it will lose interest fast.
* News media mindshare. I see lots of articles in my News app that quote and embed tweets, I have yet to see one embed a Mastodon Post.
