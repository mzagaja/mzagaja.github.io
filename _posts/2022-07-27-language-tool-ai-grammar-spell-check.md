A couple years ago I tried [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com) as an improved spell check tool. The promise is to use AI to give you a better check for spelling and grammar. However the integration options were limited and I was a bit concerned with their privacy practices. So yesterday was excited to discover [Language Tool](https://languagetool.org). It started as an open source project and the base engine remains open source. They have a clear privacy policy and you can run a copy of their engine locally. I am also impressed with the number of integrations.
