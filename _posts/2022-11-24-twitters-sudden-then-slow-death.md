In anticipation of the collapse of twitter I re-started my daily blogging habit. I fortified my [RSS reader](https://netnewswire.com) with feeds from my favorite sources. I write here mostly for myself, but am thankful for all the readers of this little corner of the Internet.

### Social Media’s Three Challenges
I never actively set out to reduce my use of and presence on social media. I still use the apps to keep a pulse on things. However three challenges drive me away from using it as much:
* Many friends and family members that I care about do not post there anymore.
* The content becomes singularly focused. It’s not interesting to read the 20th person’s outrage at today’s political news.
* Links to external content are often paywalled. I am not buying a Bloomberg subscription to read a single article.

### TikTok Moved Social Media From Friends to Influencers
I do not use TikTok, but one thing that was clear from [listening to more recent Mark Zuckerberg proclamations](https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2021/04/28/why-mark-zuckerberg-wants-influencers-to-get-rich/?sh=6eda55c86189) is that it has shifted the consumption of social media from content posted by folks friends to content posted by influencers. For me Instagram is mostly a short version of watching television, not a way to connect with friends. I enjoy the short home improvement videos I watch there, but they do not inspire me to post or share. The bar feels high.

### It’s Not Dead
Social media is far from dead. I will still post there and have accounts. However its usefulness and interestingness has waned. I am trying Mastodon but at the same time have removed the twitter app from my phone. I doubt twitter will die, but will not be surprised if it merely limps along.
