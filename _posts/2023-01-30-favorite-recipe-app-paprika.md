Keeping track of recipes you use and like can be annoying. Especially when they come from different sources. [Paprika](https://www.paprikaapp.com) simplifies this is a delightful way. I have been using it for a couple years on my iPhone, and cannot imagine cooking dinner without it.

### What I Like
* Parses recipes on websites for just the recipe. No more copy and paste.
* Built-in scaling functionality to convert all the ingredient quantities.
* Create a grocery list for shopping.
* Plan a meal schedule for the week.

### What is Missing
* I wish it integrated with Instacart
* Recommendations?
