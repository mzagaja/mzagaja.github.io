Due to the holiday weekend and travel I took a few days off from blogging. Apologies for the lack of announcement on that front. I had some weekend links to share:

- [Ignore Rubocop Changes in Git Blame](https://blog.testdouble.com/posts/2022-11-21-rubocop-git-blame/) is a handy trick for resolving the issue of how and whether you should make commits that merely refactor or restyle code but also want to make sure git blame is useful.
- [AWS and Blockchain](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2022/11/19/AWS-Blockchain) is an interesting perspective on why AWS did not push more heavily on blockchain.
- [Host Your Own Mastodon Instance on a Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/host-your-own-mastodon-instance-on-a-raspberry-pi/).
- [Co-pilot is like GPT-3 for Code](https://www.wired.com/story/openai-copilot-autocomplete-for-code/) tells the origin story of [GitHub CoPilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).
