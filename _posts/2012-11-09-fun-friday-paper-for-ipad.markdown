One of the things that I have not yet been satisfied with are the apps for iPad that attempt to emulate a notebook. I bought a stylus for my iPad about a year ago and rarely use it. However I think I have finally found something to change that. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/paper-by-fiftythree/id506003812?mt=8">Paper for iPad</a> is the first app that I've found enjoyable to use for this purpose. The virtual pen feels like a pen and is the first one that does not make my horrid handwriting look more ugly than it already is. Fast Company recently <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3002676/magical-tech-behind-paper-ipads-color-mixing-perfection">published an article</a> detailing the amount of effort that went into their color mixing tool. It is incredible that I can buy the fruits of that much labor for only $1.99 (the basic app is free but the mixing app is an in-app purchase).

To really get an idea of the potential of this application I recommend exploring the <a href="http://madewithpaper.fiftythree.com">Made with Paper</a> blog. Some of the drawings are phenomenal. I am not bold enough to share any of my own creations yet. I have mostly been making random doodles and using it like a notebook. Maybe with a little practice I will try and make something neat and share it. If you make a drawing with Paper that comes out nice feel free to share it in the comments below.
