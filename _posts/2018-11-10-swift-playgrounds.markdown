This morning I tried the Swift Playgrounds application that Apple offers for free to its iOS device users. A friend suggested I try it as a way to learn Swift. I initially ignored this tool because it seemed to be aimed at people who did not know how to code at all, but Apple did a really great job on this app. You can download a series of well designed tutorials that teach you not only the basics of programming but provide you with content for augmented reality and machine learning development. I even found a [GitHub repo with interesting third party playgrounds](https://github.com/uraimo/Awesome-Swift-Playgrounds#functional-reactive-programming). This is a much more fun and interactive way to learn coding material than the usual book method.
