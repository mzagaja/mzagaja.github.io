title: CT Democratic State Party Gets a New Communications Director
tags: []
---
At my last Democratic Town Committee meeting our Democratic State Committeeperson told me that the state party got a new communications director recently. Now if you go to the <a href="http://dems.info/index.php">state democratic party website</a> you can see events are now updated, there was an event e-mail sent out today, and the <a href="http://twitter.com/ctdems">twitter has come alive</a>. I hope the new communications director is reading MLN and might consider introducing herself. I'm looking forward to see a lot more stuff coming out of the state party in the coming months. <br />
