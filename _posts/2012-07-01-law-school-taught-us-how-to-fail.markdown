The lack of blog updates is due mostly to my intense studying for the Massachusetts and Connecticut Bar examinations. Tomorrow is the BarBri midterm. A lot of my classmates have adopted the style of cramming before their tests. I've been steadily keeping to the paced program. I know that my brain cannot absorb large amounts of information at once and retain it. So a last minute cram is not that helpful. The way you learn from BarBri is failure. You get questions wrong in certain areas, you find your weaknesses and you fix them. In law school we learn to fail and fail quickly. Everyone starts out thinking they'll get a 4.0 and be at the top of the class. Turns out that doesn't work when you are on a curve. However since you are working so hard you just pick yourself up and continue. You don't get on the journal you want, you keep going with another one. You don't get the job you applied for? You apply for more. You get a bad class grade? You learn from it then you move on. I've had a few bad practice problem sets, some really good ones, and many that sit in the middle. So I'm not terribly worried. No matter how anyone does on the practice, by putting in the work they can do better on the final. Failure is just part of the process.
