Today I watched this video by Tim Davies at the Berkman Center on open data in government and thought it was worth sharing. In the video Davies outlines three important parts of open government data: proactive sharing, machine readability, and legal ability to use and share. It seems that we often end up with open data that only hits two of these three pillars. Also while watching the video I developed another idea for an open dataset to hack on that I submitted to the CT Open Data portal, so I wanted to encourage you to [vote for it](https://data.ct.gov/nominate).
