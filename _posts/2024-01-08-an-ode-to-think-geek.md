title: An Ode to Think Geek

Before it was bought by GameStop and turned into a soulless purveyor of collectibles, ThinkGeek was “Sharper Image for sysadmins”. It’s eclectic mix of gadgets, puzzles, and yes even collectible merch made it a fun and reliable place to find a novel gift.

### Why It Matters
Sharper Image feels like a mediocre replacement. ThinkGeek was unapologetic. It seemed like they put in the effort to find novel items that were genuinely useful or fun. It was a labor of love in a way most stores are not.
