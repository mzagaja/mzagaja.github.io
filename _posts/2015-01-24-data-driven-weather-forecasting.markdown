title: A Data Driven Approach to Weather Forecasting

Given today's snow storm I thought I would share how I keep track of the weather. My favorite source of weather information is [Forecast.io](http://forecast.io) and its iOS companion app [Dark Sky](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dark-sky-weather-radar-hyperlocal/id517329357?mt=8&uo=4&at=11l74i). These applications seem to be the cleanest way to view weather information. They also have a [transparent data driven approach](http://forecast.io/raw/) to local forecasting. However I also pay attention to [Ryan Hanrahan on twitter](http://twitter.com/RyanHanrahan). He does a great job of explaining the forecast and intrepreting the data.
