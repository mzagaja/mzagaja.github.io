title: Calling it for Hillary

<p>Well it appears Hillary Clinton is the winner of the New Hampshire primary, at least the AP and NBC are calling it for her right now. I spent the day up in New Hampshire canvassing for Barack Obama, and it was an experience. However even if at the end of the night Obama loses, it&#039;s not by a wide margin. What we end up with is an open race, and Obama can still take it. I think we might really have a Super Tuesday that is much more meaningful than ones in years past.</p>
