To coincide with the symposium that my law journal is holding on Friday I will try to make several posts on sovereign debt. I am not an expert in the topic but I have read much and over the weekend I sent out an unofficial suggested reading list to my fellow law journal members. The selection of readings and audio programs are ones that I've listened to and found helpful, so I hope you enjoy them as well.
<h2>Sovereign Debt â€” Pre-Symposium Reading List</h2>
<strong>National Debt for Beginners â€“ Simon Johnson and James Kwak (Planet Money 2009) </strong><a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99927343&amp;ft=1&amp;f=94427042">http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99927343&amp;ft=1&amp;f=94427042</a>

<em>When Irish Eyes Are Crying</em> â€“ Michael Lewis (Vanity Fair 2011) â€” This article provides a great backgrounder on what is happening in Ireland with focus on the impact of their housing/construction bubble.

455: Continental Breakup â€“ Ira Glass and Alex Blumberg (This American Life 2012) â€” This is an hour show that does a great job explaining what is happening in Europe. If you want to get caught up on Europe you should listen to this (though itâ€™s now a few months old). The focus here is mostly on Greece.

Itâ€™s the Economy, Dummkopf! â€“ Michael Lewis (Vanity Fair 2011) â€” This article tells the story of the crises on the German side, with lots of Lewisâ€™s usual flair and embellishment (or for some reason that is unclear we really needed lots of paragraphs about the role of shit in German culture).
