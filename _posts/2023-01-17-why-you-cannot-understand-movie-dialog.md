Watching shows, especially movies at home, can be a frustrating experience these days. For many shows I find myself turning up the volume to understand the dialog. Then an action scene or commercial will nearly blow out my speakers with an aggressive sound level. I have often found myself turning the volume up and down throughout a show.

### Why It Matters
Besides annoying the neighbor when the sound blows out, it is not fun to watch a show without understanding the dialogue. When you encounter lots of movies or shows that do this, you might start to wonder: is it me? Well the answer is, [it’s not you, it’s Hollywood](https://www.slashfilm.com/673162/heres-why-movie-dialogue-has-gotten-more-difficult-to-understand-and-three-ways-to-fix-it/). 

### My Tricks for Dealing with Dialogue
* [Use a sound bar](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-soundbar/). Besides separating out the dialog channel of the audio for improved clarity, many have special volume balance and voice boost modes.
* Use headphones. With spatial audio I find my AirPods Pro do a great job of making audio more clear.
* Turn on Closed Captions. They look annoying but they do work.
