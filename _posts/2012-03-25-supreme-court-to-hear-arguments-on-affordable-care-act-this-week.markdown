So far the best resource I've found is the <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/category/special-features/health-care/">SCOTUS Blog</a>.The New York Times has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/26/us/in-supreme-court-health-care-case-training-for-a-legal-marathon.html">an interesting article</a> on the attorneys practicing for the oral arguments while Jeffrey Toobin at the New Yorker <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2012/03/26/120326taco_talk_toobin">has an article as well</a>. We should have a decision by sometime in June.

The thing that I found most bothersome is that the Obama administration has decided not to argue in favor of the severability of the act. This means if the insurance mandate fails, the entire Act will fall with it. All the reforms and progress of the past year will be pretty much zapped. As someone who benefitted from a provision in the act allowing me to remain on my parent's health insurance until I am 26, I am watching this with much interest.
