If you enjoy museums you should check out the <a href="http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute">Google Cultural Institute</a>. This not so well publicized website serves as a virtual repository of important cultural events. Some of the exhibits are merely old photographs that are neat to look at. Others are full storyboards that involve text, photographs, virtual documents, and videos of the event posted to YouTube. Most of the virtual exhibits are composed of primary source material from actual museums or other archives. Overall it is well done and I hope other museums would consider replicating this format. If a particular exhibit sticks out to you, or you find a similar resource, please consider sharing it in the comments. So far one of the better ones I found was the <a href="http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/#!exhibit:exhibitId=QRN92NBb&amp;position=0%2C7">exhibit on the Berlin Wall</a>.
