I've been fighting a cold so I don't feel the energy to write much but I wanted to make sure I shared some links relevant to my previous posts about technology in the classroom and education reform.

First today's New York Times has a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/16/opinion/kristof-the-new-haven-experiment.html">column by Nick Kristof on New Haven's education experiment</a>. Kristof explains how much better things can go when two sides work together.

Second I would be remiss if I didn't suggest checking out Colin McEnroe's twitter where he discusses his article with Rep. Gary Holder-Winfield and Al Robinson (of MyLeftNutmeg). I don't know a good way to link a twitter conversation so I'll leave you with a link to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/colinmcenroe">McEnroe's twitter</a> and you'll have to read it backwards from there.

Finally I wanted to make sure I linked to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/13/education/mooresville-school-district-a-laptop-success-story.html">this article</a> about the success of technology in a classroom in North Carolina. It was interesting to read that they laid off teachers to pay for the MacBooks, an all-in bet if I've ever seen one. However the fact that it's working suggests that they have figured out how to properly use the technology. I think that other districts could replicate the success with less expensive hardware.
