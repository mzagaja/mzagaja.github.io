title: PACs making incursions into Connecticut General Assembly Races
tags: []

I read <a href="http://www.ctmirror.org/story/17906/billionaires-super-pac-takes-aim-general-assembly">this article</a> with interest today because it seems to be the second instance of a PAC dumping a large amount of money in a race for a seat in the Connecticut General Assembly. These kinds of incursions have the potential to undermine the spirit of Connecticut's public financing system. However I think it is important to point out that the threat may be overblown. Connecticut has consistently demonstrated that campaign spending suffers from diminishing marginal utility. Candidates like Linda McMahon and Tom Foley who spend large sums of money on their campaigns have failed to beat their opponents that have spent less. My question is whether you think Connecticut should take additional steps to stop this, and whether you think it will make a difference.
