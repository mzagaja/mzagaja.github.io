I finished finals yesterday and so my first summer project (besides finding an internship) is learning how to process and visualize raw data using tools on my computer. I bought the O'Reilly Data Bootcamp video from their Strata Conference and hope to learn some new things with it over the next day or two. The first pitfall I encountered was setting up my Macbook Pro with the proper tools. The bootcamp requirements are <a href="http://strataconf.com/strata2011/public/schedule/detail/17164">here</a> and they include use of Python. The version that comes pre-installed did not appear to function well so I had to download the latest one from Python.org. I also had to install XCode (included on the Mac OS X install CD) before I could get all the modules installed. I plan on doing the course tomorrow and will post a review and results.
