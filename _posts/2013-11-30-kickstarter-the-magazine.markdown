One of the publications I enjoy is [The Magazine](http://the-magazine.org) which has been described as The New Yorker for nerds. Started by Instapaper and Tumblr Founder Marco Arment, The Magazine publishes several medium to long articles every other week. If you have not had a chance to read The Magazine I recommend checking out their [Kickstarter project](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/glennf/the-magazine-the-book-year-one) where they are raising money to publish many of the articles in a physical book.
