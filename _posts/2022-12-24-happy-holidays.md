The blog will be off tomorrow for the Christmas holiday. We will be returning briefly on Monday and Tuesday, with a break Wednesday through Friday. I still have weekend links for you today…

- [Amazons New Robot Won’t Fix It’s Worker Injury Problems](https://www.wired.com/story/amazons-worker-injury-problem/)
- [Unredactor](https://github.com/BishopFox/unredacter) is an impressive and little scary proof of concept that can take blurred or pixelated text and figure out what it said. Maybe better to redact with full erasing going forward.
- [The Beeck Center at Georgetown is looking for a fellow to work on its Intergovernmental Software Collaborative](https://beeckcenter.georgetown.edu/jobs/fellow-intergovernmental-software-collaborative/). Sounds like an exciting position for someone into Civic Tech, and fully remote!
- [Rails is going to have first class support for Docker](https://github.com/rails/docked). Neat.
- Julia Evans new [Pocket Guide to Debugging](https://wizardzines.com/zines/debugging-guide/) is a great last minute Christmas gift for the coder in your life.
