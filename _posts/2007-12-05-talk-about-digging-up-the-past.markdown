<p>The other day the Hillary Clinton campaign issued a <a href="http://www.hillaryclinton.com/news/release/view/?id=4479">press release</a> attacking Barack Obama for being ambitious, and managed to dig up a third grade essay he wrote. I think it is preposterous to criticize Obama for this. When we are young, and even in college making life plans, we all have ideas and dreams as to what we&#039;d like to be when we grow-up. They are not all serious. When I was in first grade I wanted to be an astronaut.<br />
In spite of all this, having worked on campaigns and such, people do not normally get elected by accident. It&#039;s a lot of work to be a candidate, and you need to want it if you are to get elected. Of all the issues and differences between the candidates in this campaign, I find this one to be rather petty. If you are running for an office, including President, there is always going to be a component of ambition there.</p>
