<blockquote>I Promised â€“ You Delivered â€“ The Checks Are Cut
By jxpaton
Folks,

Take a bow â€“ you did it!

Our goal was to hit $40M in profit in 2010. Well you did better than that â€“ you hit more than $41M. Not bad for a bankrupt, beat up old newspaper company people had written off as dead in 2009.</blockquote>

I don't know what blows my minds more:

1. That this "dead" newspaper company innovated like crazy to revive itself in such a short period.
2. That a CEO decided to share the success with his employees. (Serious leadership there)
4. That the paper turned $41 million in profit!
5. That this happened in Connecticut.
