### U2’s Wide and Enduring Appeal
The [extended cut highlights U2’s intergenerational and international appeal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peMw65Pljoc). Rock and Roll has struggled to maintain its cultural cachet with the rise of TikTok and Instagram Reels. Bands like Coldplay have leaned into collaborating with acts like The Chainsmokers to maintain relevance. However U2 transcends this with a robust back catalog and intergenerational success from Joshua Tree in 1987 to All That You Can’t Leave Behind in 2001. 

### Larry Mullen Jr. Takes Time Off
This is the first time U2 will be playing live to fans since 2019 and they will be doing it without drummer Larry Mullen Jr. In a [Washington Post article Bono revealed that Mullen Jr. has spine issues he needs surgery for](https://wapo.st/3E3e71A). Dutch drummer Bram van der Berg will fill-in for Mullen Jr.
