I really enjoyed [this interview](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/bonus-casey-neistat-full-interview/id430333725?i=1000407270501&mt=2) with Casey Neistat by Nilay Patel. It is rare for an entrepreneur to be so open with sharing the challenges around something that did not work out. In Casey’s case he talks about how his former company, Beme, was acquired by CNN. After a while the organization was absorbed into CNN proper and Casey and his chief technology officer parted ways with CNN. While I enjoy Casey Neistat’s video blogs for their optimism, the realism of discussing failure makes him a more relatable person.
