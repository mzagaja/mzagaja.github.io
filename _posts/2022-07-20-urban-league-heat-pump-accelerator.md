title: Announcing Urban League Heat Pump Accelerator Project
layout: post
---
As a part of my volunteer work with [Code for Boston](https://www.codeforboston.org) I am helping to launch the Urban League Heat Pump Accelerator Project to accelerate the adoption of heat pumps in the Boston region, with a focus on equity.

Volunteers will participate in building an application that imports data on properties in the Boston area and then building and tuning algorithms to help the [Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts](https://www.ulem.org/) focus its outreach on heat pump adoption. Later phases will include building a front-end for Urban League outreach workers and folks at the [Heat Smart Alliance](https://heatsmartalliance.org/).
