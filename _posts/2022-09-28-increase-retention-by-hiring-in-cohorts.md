title: Increase Retention by Hiring Software Engineers in Cohorts

If you are leading a non-technical organization and want to hire software engineers, one of the best things you can do is hire two or three at once.

### Why do this?
Often times non-profits or public interest organizations are not hiring software engineers at market rates. Software engineers get lonely. Making sure there is a peer that understands their work and they can lean on makes for a much better experience as an employee. They might stay longer.

### These roles are still stepping stones
* According to Levels.fyi [the median software engineer salary in the Greater Boston Area is $159,000](https://www.levels.fyi/t/software-engineer/locations/greater-boston-area).
* The [average tenure for a software engineer is four years across the industry](https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/04/19/whats-the-average-tenure-of-an-engineer-at-a-big-tech-company-ep-434/).

### My experience
Regardless of how much someone says they want to stay forever or they care about the mission they leave after a year or so. I helped a lot of engineers train up and get projects on their resume that looked great in their interview at Google. 

### Dealing with high churn
If you have to hire folks you know are likely to leave after a year or two keep your technology simple:
* Pick one stack and hire for and use it. Don’t let a new hire try a different programming language because it’s easier for them. It turns into another programming language or library for the next hire to learn.
* Abstract DevOps with tools like Heroku or Netlify. Many newer software engineers do not know Linux and server administration.
* Use the two week (one sprint) rule: if it takes longer than two weeks to implement a feature it is going to be too complicated for the next software engineer to maintain.
