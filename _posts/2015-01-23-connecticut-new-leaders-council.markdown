Last year my friend Wade Gibson asked me to help him build a Connecticut chapter of the [New Leaders Council](http://www.newleaderscouncil.org) organization. Wade and others put much work into building up our chapter. These are the kinds of things that require teamwork. Money had to be raised, venues secured, candidates interviewed, curriculum developed, and a communications strategy executed. This was not a small task, it was a year in the making.

Tomorrow we will have our first fellows training session in New Haven. We have an [impressive inaugural class](http://www.newleaderscouncil.org/connecticut_2015_fellows). They are giving up their weekends for the next few months for this project. They will be Connecticut's future leaders. Some will go on to serve on local boards and commissions. Some may run for the legislature. I hope we end up with some that run for Congress or Governor one day.
