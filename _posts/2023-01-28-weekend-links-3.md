- [Google calls in help from Larry Page and Sergey Brin for AI Fight](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/20/technology/google-chatgpt-artificial-intelligence.html?unlocked_article_code=1PQlSFeHp4d-lNElkza1svCzZmQTK4QlspZPZVY5wnav_WpDvWwaIiTe5wJ6SLHFNPiiGWEUSyZFIfvi6kUYnMupnSdff4Nb190P56TF6zti9I9X-SqElp_uE59ZVIXyxXLD7j8ce0pTg3s1FZ0dEGpLijc1jc1EywJkUiVG9-QQ0fE9ba3glUeVNn0FhobS7IObgwhj8Jk2UB5f8P6zwLqU89Gy0kOYK7fyuzWDJOviD1ZdL7HkGfDsjkCwF8SQ9M5y91a-p6bP5565zLZs0znaDVyRap7kss1roiNIvBMkkJBVzMxjyyofIL_mdR6iuijUCBWIC5rsFewjHgmq2s_78kd2RMsg_WtlXLf-S4YdpoE&smid=share-url). It’s too bad they don’t treat filtering out low quality content farms with the same seriousness.
- [Why we all need subtitles now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYJtb2YXae8) goes deep [into a topic I explored last week](https://www.zagaja.com/2023/01/why-you-cannot-understand-movie-dialog/).
- Tapbots, maker of Tweetbots, has released [Ivory for Mastodon](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ivory-for-mastodon-by-tapbots/id6444602274). Paul and Mark are talented app builders and this is by far the most enjoyable way to use the growing Mastodon network. Coincidentally you can now follow [Phil Schiller](https://mastodon.social/@pschiller@mstdn.social) there.
- [Cory Doctorow writes on the enshittification of TikTok](https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/). A long but insightful explainer why social networks and Google search have been getting worse over time.
- From the archives: [John Mayer covers American Pie for David Letterman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPZGXIk98xQ).
- [The lights at a Massachusetts school have been on for over a year because nobody can turn them off](https://apple.news/AbPRptbmDRuOxuImdatz7Og). 
- [The FBI shut down a major ransomware gang](https://wapo.st/3XKy8Se). Impressive work by the feds here.
