title: Apple is Rebuilding Apple Maps from the Ground Up
---
Interesting to see [Apple’s deep focus on updating maps](https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/29/apple-is-rebuilding-maps-from-the-ground-up/):
>It’s doing this by using first-party data gathered by iPhones with a privacy-first methodology and its own fleet of cars packed with sensors and cameras. The new product will launch in San Francisco and the Bay Area with the next iOS 12 beta and will cover Northern California by fall.
