When I was an undergrad at WPI I worked on a project with a startup that was working to encourage the adoption of renewable energy sources. I was disappointed to learn that [the system is being nixed](http://www.rarereminder.com/story.php?id=200532&story=Committee_Nixes_Geothermal_System_at_High_School). The cost of energy in Connecticut is high and will likely only increase. With incentives I would expect installing a Geothermal system to be a net win for the town.

On a related note I also find it disappointing that the state has [stalled in lifting its ban on wind turbines](http://www.nhregister.com/environment-and-nature/20130926/connecticut-panel-rejects-large-scale-wind-power-rules). As a state that is trying to lead on energy issues I would expect us to be doing more to encourage this.
