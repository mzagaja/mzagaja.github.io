From the [NPR Car Talk host in Washington Post](https://wapo.st/3SsygTR):
> some car manufacturers don’t want to share key information for diagnosing and fixing cars with independent shops — and that’s something that’s not only bad for repair shops but also bad for you.

### It’s Not Just Cars
iFixit has long been [advocating for a right to repair](https://www.ifixit.com/Right-to-Repair/Intro). Their focus is on electronics. They warn if you cannot repair an item then you are going to throw it away. This is bad for both your wallet and the environment.

### Independent Shops are Less Expensive than Dealers and Manufacturers
Dealers and manufacturers charge higher prices. In some situations they can make more effective repairs and ensure you have good quality parts. In other cases they are overkill or will not provide less expensive options to resolve your issues.

* Apple would not sell me a new plastic headband for my Beats Headphones but I was able to fix it with a $20 kit from Amazon.
* Tech reporters were [shocked when Apple started offering folks the option to buy or rent their official tools to replace iPhone batteries](https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/21/23079058/apple-self-service-iphone-repair-kit-hands-on). iFixit [has long offered a do it yourself kit](https://www.ifixit.com/Store/iPhone/iPhone-12-12-Pro-Battery/IF442-002?o=2) that requires much smaller tools.

### Automakers Stall Massachusetts Right to Repair in Court
Massachusetts passed it’s [right to repair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_Vehicle_Owners'_Right_to_Repair_Act) in 2020. It still has not taken effect.
* Car makers are claiming that the demand for an open access platform is not possible.
* They also [claimed there are cybersecurity issues if they open up their systems](https://www.dataprivacyandsecurityinsider.com/2020/10/a-deeper-dive-into-the-privacy-cybersecurity-concerns-about-massachusetts-ballot-question-1/).
