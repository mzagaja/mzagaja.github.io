Yesterday my colleagues at TED launched [My Library](https://www.ted.com/dashboard/my-library). A feature for registered users to be able to view their saved, liked, and watched talks and playlists in one place. I worked on some of the preliminary parts of this a while back, and am excited because it’s something I have been waiting for a while.

### Why It Matters
One of my favorite things on YouTube is to be able to save talks for later. Now on the TED website you can add talks to your list and see them in a queue to watch when you want. You can also find and re-experience old favorites.
