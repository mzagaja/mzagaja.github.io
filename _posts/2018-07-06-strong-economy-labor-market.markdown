> More than that, Iowa’s tight labor market has forced employers to offer training, reach out to new populations of workers, and accept applications from workers they might not have before — expanding and up-skilling the labor pool as a whole as a result. “Their attitude really seems to be changing,” said Soneeta Mangra-Dutcher of Central Iowa Works, a workforce-development nonprofit. “They are looking at populations differently, who they they should be looking at when they have jobs to fill, or people being screened out for things that really don't have an effect on the job.”

Often times “we cannot find the right worker” is simply code for “we are not willing to pay the right worker” or to train them.
