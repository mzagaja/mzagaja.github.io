From [Waldo Jaquith](https://waldo.jaquith.org/blog/2023/02/governors-double-down/):
> It’s happens at least once in every gubernatorial administration: presented with a disastrous, multi-year, failing software project that’s preventing an agency from accomplishing its mission, the governor awards a big contract to a big vendor, maybe even the vendor that’s the source of the problem. Some major culprits are unemployment insurance, enterprise resource planning, Medicaid, child welfare, and payroll—all load-bearing systems for their agencies. Solving these failures by signing another big contract nearly always makes things worse. So why do governors do this?


### Why It Matters
Outsourcing technology projects to vendors creates [a classic principle-agent problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal–agent_problem). Not every vendor is bad and not every outsourced project goes wrong, but many will cost more than if government did things in-house. Failed software projects impact trust in government and make life worse for residents.
