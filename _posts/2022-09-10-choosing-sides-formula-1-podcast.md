As someone who is newer to Formula 1 I have been enjoying the [Choosing Sides podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/choosing-sides-f1/id1625953243). Each episode explores the history and background of a Formula 1 team. Itâ€™s a great way to get up to speed on both the drivers and the differences between all the teams.
