Today is WWDC 2023. Apple will be announcing the improvements to the newest iterations of its operating systems. Rumor has it they will also be announcing new products including a MacBook Air 15” and virtual reality/mixed reality headset.

### When and Where to Watch
[1 p.m. Eastern Time on the Apple Website](https://www.apple.com/apple-events/).

### What They’re Saying

[Mark Gurman at Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-06-04/apple-s-aapl-first-mixed-reality-headset-arrives-after-years-in-development-lihfkxgw?cmpid=BBD060423_POWERON&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=230604&utm_campaign=poweron):
> I believe — like Apple — that the headset could be the future of the computer and that the company needs to start somewhere. While the first model will likely be a flop in terms of unit sales — at least compared with Apple’s other categories — the company could still become the market leader within a matter of quarters.

[John Gruber of Daring Fireball](https://mastodon.social/@gruber/110481656957947644): 
> If I could pick just one feature for Apple to add in iOS 17, it would be a system-wide clipboard history. (Or APIs that would allow third-party apps to implement a system-wide clipboard history, but I think sandboxing would make that impossible. Probably has to be an OS feature.)

### What I Want to See
- Markdown support for the Notes app.
- More Reminders and E-Mail App Improvements
- Custom search providers in Safari outside of the blessed ones.
