On Saturday I attended the [Public Interest Technology Summit](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/digitalhks/event/public-interest-technology-summit) at Harvard Kennedy School. About eighty people gathered to learn about and discuss issues related to public interest technology. Public interest technology is the term the [Ford Foundation is using](https://www.fordfoundation.org/campaigns/public-interest-tech/) to describe the field that many of us currently call civic tech. It was a worthwhile summit where I networked and learned a lot.

One session I attended was facilitated by Nick Sinai and focused on how to get students into the field. Students involved in the group [Coding it Forward](https://www.codingitforward.com) were there to share their experiences and how their program worked. It was helpful to get the experience of college students but I was disappointed to learn one of the founders of the group chose a job with Google instead of government, as rational as that decision was.

Another session was focused on [David Eaves maturity model for digital services groups](https://medium.com/digitalhks/digital-services-convening-part-1-6ecee1c0953e). The session emphasized that the product of digital services groups is culture change and there was a focus on user centered design. User centered design is the design and management side of what software developers might know as [agile](http://agilemanifesto.org). Working together these two methodologies allow teams to deliver products that do a better job of fixing problems more quickly.
