The blog is off for the holiday weekend, to return on Tuesday. So I leave you weekend links.

- [Paramount Plus is raising prices when it merges with Showtime](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/16/23602432/paramount-plus-price-increase-showtime-streaming). Just in time for the last season of Picard to finish. Most of the new Star Trek shows have been disappointing to me. Not sure I will keep this one.
- [A Conversation with Bingâ€™s Chatbot Left Me Deeply Unsettled](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/bing-chatbot-microsoft-chatgpt.html?unlocked_article_code=A5O8w4tvvLkc84dWXkEXonB5BDoaVqQuhCsktBsDb8TPjc0isBPHYs4vLpnjdcO0k5fKUWesUTd_7SHMwNJ-XzadDsKSydy-1o5E3zfAAsMEKA_jolkGRF8WWZ_UwWZjsZNeYy5Gjn-eqyY0vqJXmTnjgEa0PM0eeFOt--nAEc4KyJHwSgHaJX50Io19JGYCOaI3lbdPY5QTvoowsxMKx6OYbwjJhZ5IUPHu23oXvMCMAwdn4JtBQR2jJLge-e9wBKCr4_jkIVKRtHHeTCkXOu0PCeRAuwr59MzWzsmy0iFsU0zr9eldp5-uHkaCYRQRFk0J9AB0IrPUP2DftZ9nUDSYFCmVU7iKRjQu&smid=url-share) was a bit disturbing. However you have to remember that AI does not feel, it is acting.
- [The popular Mastodon client Ivory is releasing a Mac version](https://tapbots.com/ivory/mac/). Ivory remains a reason I like/check Mastodon, but it still feels a bit empty in there compared to twitter.
- [Best Wide Foot Running Shoes for 2023](https://believeintherun.com/best-wide-foot-running-shoes/) is a decent collection of reviews of running shoes for wide footers. Being a 4E in shoe width, my options always feel limited. 
- Currently Reading: [Tracers in the Dark](https://amzn.to/3lLf6gw). Finally a well written non-fiction crime novel that actually understands the technology behind Bitcoin.
