title: On WPI and Exxon Mobil

My friends at WPI have been posting about the fact that Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson was chosen to be their commencement speaker this year. I've seen comments on both sides and there is a <a href="http://wpi2011.wordpress.com/">movement to protest the speech</a>. Concerns have been raised primarily about Exxon Mobil's corporate ethics and their contributions to global climate change. Based on the comments on facebook the protest group is attempting to be flexible and undisruptive in their actions. However the unfortunate result of this debacle is that this commencement is now about politics instead of the graduates. I can only hope that next month those on both sides of this debate will be able to celebrate together and focus on building a better future.
