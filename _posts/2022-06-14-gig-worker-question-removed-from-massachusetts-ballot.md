title: Gig Worker Question Removed from Massachusetts Ballot
---
From [the Boston Globe](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/06/14/business/mass-high-court-blocks-gig-worker-question-november-ballot/):
> Massachusetts’ top court on Tuesday rejected a controversial ballot question that could have reshaped how gig economy workers are classified in Massachusetts, ruling that it was built on “vaguely worded provisions” that melded two different subjects and thus violated the constitution.

Glad to see this one kicked. These sorts of questions are better suited to the legislature than a large public vote.
