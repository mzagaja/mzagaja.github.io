I listened the the TED talk on my iPod and thought <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">this is amazing</a>. Lessons and practice problems for a variety of subjects on one website. The format is better than many of the other open courseware sites I've been to online. The talk is embedded below. Enjoy!
