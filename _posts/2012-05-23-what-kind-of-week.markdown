On Sunday I finally graduated from law school. Those three years fly by so quickly. A graduation is a conflict of emotion: excitement for the next adventure and also a feeling of sadness as I will be leaving the school I loved so much and many friends will be moving away. I was lucky enough to be joined by some family friends at the ceremony and then we went out to dinner afterwards. My parents even surprised me with a beautiful cake that had an oreo frosting filling in the center that was delicious.

The bittersweet part of a graduation, especially from law school is that as soon as you finish bar review begins. I'm still working on my job search and finishing up the last parts of my Connecticut bar application but next week I will have to start studying for the Massachusetts and Connecticut bar exams full-time. I opted for the BarBri program that most students sign-up for. It is expensive, nearly $3000. However they give you all the books, lectures, and other material you need to pass.

I of course decided to geek out and install the mobile app on my iPhone. The app lets you to play the video lectures and tackle practice questions. I decided that I wanted to watch the lectures on a bigger screen so I bought the Apple HDMI adapter for the phone and plugged it into the television on the porch. The picture quality is not quite as good as the screen on the phone but it is fine for the BarBri videos. It certainly makes it easier to pay attention to than the little phone screen and is less distracting than streaming it on my MacBook. My friends assure me that I can work on my own time with the video lectures and need only attend the live classes for the simulations, but I will probably go to the first one to check it out.

There's nothing terribly exciting about bar review. It's just something to grind out. So do not worry, I will not post about the intricacies of agency liability or sixth amendment rights.
