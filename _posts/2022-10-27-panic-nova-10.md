title: My Favorite Text Editor

Yesterday Panic Software released [Nova 10](https://nova.app). Nova is a text editor, it competes with Vim and VSCode. This release re-affirms the commitment Panic has made to this product, matches the [best features of VSCode](https://nova.app/releases/), and most importantly integrates [Tree Sitter for vastly improved syntax highlighting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jes3bD6P0To). 

## What is New?
* Show the git blame in a comment when you click a line.
* Sticky class and method names as you scroll make it easier to identify what code youâ€™re looking at.
* Comments now fold, making it easy to throw lots of documentation in them but quickly scroll a code file.
* A new diff view for quickly comparing your revisions with previous versions.

## Why not VSCode?
Panic Nova is a native Mac app. If you use other Mac apps it looks and feels like them. The performance and memory management are great. When I was looking to switch text editors, VSCode had a [painful screen flickering bug](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/41238) that prevented me from using it. I found Panic Nova and never looked back.

## The Downsides
The fact Nova is not as popular as VSCode means there is a smaller extension library. Ruby debug support is not yet built-in, and the Solargraph extension is not fully working. For a product I use everyday missing features I can use from the command line is not a huge deal, but I can understand other developers missing them. I have been developing extensions to help it match what is available with VSCode, starting with [Rubocop](nova://extension/?id=zagaja.Rubocop&name=RuboCop).

## The Big Upside
Panic provides great support. Every time I have a question Mike from Panic answers my email within 24 hours with a useful response. My feedback seems to be genuinely considered and taken to heart. Finally every [post I have made to the extension forum](https://devforum.nova.app/t/how-do-i-read-a-files-contents/1808) has been replied to with a useful response.
