The Chief Data Officer of the State of Connecticut has posted his [Draft Open Data Policy](https://data.ct.gov/browse?tags=odp&utf8=âœ“) for public comment on the Connecticut Data Portal. I will likely share my thoughts once I finish reviewing and formulating them, but overall it seems to follow many of the best practices espoused by the public data community. It is good to see that this is being taken seriously by someone in state government, but also disappointing to see the lack of views and engagement by the general public. I hope you will take a look and add your comments to the Google Doc.
