title: Building a Legislative Bill Tracking Site

A year ago I started work on [bills.ctnewsjunkie.com](https://bills.ctnewsjunkie.com/), a place where people can express their opinions on bills before the Connecticut General Assembly. The nice thing about bills.ctnewsjunkie.com is its pretty simple. All you need to do is vote up or down a bill depending on if you like it. Then we display those votes so readers know how popular a bill before the Connecticut General Assembly is with the rest of readership.

The surprising thing is how well this has taken off. Last year we launched the site and it was not popular. We did not see a lot of voting. This year the participation in voting has been explosive. We are seeing lots of traffic to the site and more votes than we ever imagined being cast to show support or opposition to bills. It is exciting because it shows people do care about issues at the state level and want to share their opinions on them.
