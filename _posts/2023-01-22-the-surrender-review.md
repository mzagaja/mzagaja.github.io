In November I went to Bono’s Broadway-esque book talk (more of a show) and started reading [Surrender](https://amzn.to/3J74lP9). Clocking in at over 500 pages it is a long book that is a series of shorter stories spanning Bono’s life. Bono takes us on a time machine tour of moments ranging from the formation of U2 to dining with the Obamas in the White house. Where many autobiographies can be antiseptic, Surrender has grit and honesty. 

### Who It’s For
Surrender will satisfy any U2 fan. If you are interested in the music business, philanthropy, or enjoy lyrical writing then Surrender will satisfy your taste buds. If you enjoy autobiographies generally, this one is one of the better written and more interesting ones.

### Easy to Pick-up
Each chapter clocks in at three to fifteen pages, which makes it easy to read one or two chapters at a time. If you have a short attention span or want something to fill a small amount of time before going to sleep then this tome can last  you a while.
