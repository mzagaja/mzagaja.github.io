It's midnight and nearly one year after Hurricane Irene knocked out power for a week we are going to get hit with a comparably powerful storm. The meteorologists and public officials are not sugar coating it. Houses near the shore are being evacuated and we've been told that power might not be restored for days. I am digging in and have reading material to occupy me when the Internet dies. However I probably will not be able to blog much or at all. If it is anything like Irene I will probably have intermittent cell service for the first day or so. Hopefully it won't be as bad as they are saying but I am prepared for the worst.
