title: Indoor Air Quality is Awful After Cooking

With the arrival of smoke from the Canadian wildfires I picked up an automatic air purifier. Its sensor will speed up when air quality is bad, and boy does it pick it up when I am cooking.

### Why It Matters
As one of the large number of folks without an outdoor vent, I rarely gave thought to indoor pollution from cooking. However the sensor shows that when searing meats on a skillet or similar activity, the lack of outdoor vent means there is lots of particulate pollution in the air. No wonder the smoke alarm sometimes goes off when Iâ€™m doing this.
