* DHH [weighs in on GitHub CoPilot reminds us of the values of the open source community](https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-scarcity-scarecrows-of-open-source-325f6d2b).
* I found [a well done tutorial on using the shell/command line for new folks](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/). Using the command line gives you super powers and I am always surprised how many software developers are not fully comfortable with it.
* [The Benefits of Not Being a Jerk to Yourself](https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_harris_the_benefits_of_not_being_a_jerk_to_yourself) was one of my favorite talks from TED2022.
* [Journalists Investigate Which Neighborhoods In Your City are Offered the Worst Internet Deals](https://themarkup.org/story-recipes/2022/10/19/journalists-investigate-which-neighborhoods-in-your-city-are-offered-the-worst-internet-deals) executes on a project I wish I could have done seven years ago. Glad to see the evolution of the law make this possible.
* [Documents Detail Plans to Gut Twitterâ€™s Workforce](https://wapo.st/3seLvvX) is probably a bummer for twitter employees, but most tech commentators seem to agree that the organization is bloated.
