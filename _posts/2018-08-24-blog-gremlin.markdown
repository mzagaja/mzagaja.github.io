The other day I wrote a post about going to the dentist and it apparently was reverted from its finished state before I mindlessly committed the post to GitHub. As a result everyone was left with a bit of a cliffhanger, which I have now removed. Unfortunately the result is a post that barely had a story or useful thought.

Rather than trying to re-complete the blog post I am leaving it there as a shrine to the idea that when you go up to bat so often youâ€™re sometimes going to hit a few foul balls. I have some exciting future posts in the hopper about my work at [Code for Boston](http://www.codeforboston.org/) that should hopefully make up for it.
