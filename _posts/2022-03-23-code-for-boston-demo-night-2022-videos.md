Yesterday I got the produced videos from Code for Bostonâ€™s 2022 Demo Night. Instead of doing the video work ourselves we tried contracting out a vendor this year. This means they were filmed with better cameras, and they plugged directly into the AV system in our venue for high quality audio. With about half of our participants being remote, we thought it was worth providing a higher quality experience for our virtual event attendees. They are now available in a [handy YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKHKcSbTn_eo8BIE_qLoS2B-AP7swqXWK).
