If you are an Apple fan you have probably heard Jonathan Mann's work. His [song about the iPhone 4 antenna problems](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKIcaejkpD4) was featured in an Apple press conference. I did not know that he also wrote a song about Paul Krugmen. In fact he writes [a song a day](http://jonathanmann.net). I embedded the Krugman song below:
