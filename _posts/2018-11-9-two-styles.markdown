title: Two Styles

In organizations there are two types of communication that people can engage in: synchronous and asynchronous. I find synchronous communication to be best for trying to get agreement or dig into beefy topics. Asynchronous can often work for everything else. However the big challenge with asynchronous communication is it is easily ignored. This leads to needing synchronous communication for things that would otherwise work asynchronously. Since synchronous communication is massively more expensive, this slows things down.

Ultimately this issue is about two different styles. Unfortunately the synchronous style will rarely be effective with people who are only used to synchronous communication. This can lead to two issues. The first is that the asynchronous communicators can fail to engage folks who desire synchronous communication. The asynchronous folks might be viewed as distant or aloof. The asynchronous folks might be view synchronous folks in the same way. By not communicating in writing the synchronous communicators seem distant or aloof to the asynchronous folks. You can quickly see how translation is hard.

The solution to succeed is to be adaptable. There are advantages and disadvantages to both styles, but you should not limit yourself to carrying the burden of adapting. If a person and a team is to grow and succeed they should be proficient and effective in both styles. Such a person can be both a translator between the two types of people, and also leverage the best parts of each style to achieve their goals.
