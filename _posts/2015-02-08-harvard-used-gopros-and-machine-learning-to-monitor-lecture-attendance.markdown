An [interesting slide deck](http://hilt.harvard.edu/files/hilt/files/attendancestudy.pdf) on something that I think most professors already knew and noticed. Students often skip lectures and attendance drops off near the end of the semester. This happened in both my undergrad and in law school. My general sense is that a lot of students felt they could simply learn through self-study and did not get much value out of the lectures. If you can pull it off it's probably not a huge problem, but for students who struggle to get good grades I think that this kind of data will be critical in trying to figure out how to engage them and help them improve their performance.

Of course this data is not nearly as bad as the rather [dismal completion rate for MOOCs](https://www.edx.org/blog/edxs-first-course-research-highlights#.VNf-sUK29jA).
