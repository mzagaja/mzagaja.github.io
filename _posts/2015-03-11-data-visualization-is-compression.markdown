I cannot believe I missed [this TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/david_mccandless_the_beauty_of_data_visualization) by David McCandless from [Infomration is Beautiful](http://www.informationisbeautiful.net). The most important point that he made was how long it took him to make a single graphic in his book, and that graphic provided context that otherwise did not exist. A lot of times people will put numbers on top of an image, but that kind of visualization does not have the impact that McCandless's visualizations have. Check out the website and share your favorites in the comments.
