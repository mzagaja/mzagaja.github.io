<p>
  I'm Matt Zagaja, an attorney with background in politics, science, and
  technology residing in Massachusetts. I am a Senior Backend Engineer at
  <a href="https://www.ted.com">TED</a> and am
  on the leadership team of
  <a href="http://www.codeforboston.org/">Code for Boston</a>. I spend much of
  my time using technology to improve government.
</p>

<p>
  My first job was fixing and configuring computers and networks for individuals
  and small businesses in Connecticut. I taught myself HTML, CSS, and
  JavaScript. I built machines from parts, configured them for networks, and
  recovered data from broken hard drives.
</p>

<p>
  In politics I worked for every campaign that former Connecticut Governor
  Malloy ran since 2006. I helped Elizabeth Esty unseat an incumbent Republican
  state representative in 2008. Then in 2013 I
  <a

    >managed Matthew Nemerson's mayoral race in New Haven</a
  >
  before he dropped out to endorse Mayor Toni Harp. In 2014 I worked for the
  Connecticut Democratic Party as its Deputy Data Director. I have also
  volunteered as treasurer for several campaigns and interned for the
  Connecticut State Elections Enforcement Commission.
</p>

<p>
  I have also consulted for numerous start-up companies in the technology
  sector. Some of that experience was through UConn Law's IP Clinic where I
  helped the companies secure trademarks and assisted in the drafting of
  patents. Other times it has been through individual contracts with the
  companies or through the UConn Business School's Innovation Accelerator
  program where I created market research reports that companies used to secure
  investments and plan their future. In January 2015 I
  <a href="http://lon.tv/ces2015">helped Lon Seidman cover CES 2015</a> for his
  YouTube Channel. I think technology start-ups are critical to the future of
  the country. Thus I am passionate and enjoy writing about legal and policy
  issues around them like network neutrality, patents, copyright, security and
  privacy.

  Besides serving as Lead Web Developer at MAPC, I also collaborate with
  CTNewsJunkie on two projects:
  <a href="https://vote.ctnewsjunkie.com/">vote.ctnewsjunkie.com</a> and
  <a href="https://bills.ctnewsjunkie.com">bills.ctnewsjunkie.com</a>. I enjoy
  working on these projects as experiments in increasing civic engagement
  through data and software.
